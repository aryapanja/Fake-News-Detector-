With apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this week–FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton’s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. 
As we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened 
— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
Of course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be Anthony Weiner’s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. 
But according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz’ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn’t even know about Comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn’t receive Comey’s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn’ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” 
So let’s see if we’ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. 
There has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. 
What it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don’t know what does. 
Granted, it’s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. But that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World. About Darrell Lucus

1,"FLYNN: Hillary Clinton, Big Woman on Campus - Breitbart",Daniel J. Flynn,"Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.’ What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?” The “trust bust” certainly busted Clinton’s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people —  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November’s election —  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a “lie,” a “con,” “alternative facts,” and “a   assault on truth and reason. ” She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. “As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” she offered. “That is not hyperbole. ” Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that “for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. ” Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn’t president. The woman famously dubbed a “congenital liar” by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in —  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.",0
2,Why the Truth Might Get You Fired,Consortiumnews.com,"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 
The tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. 
By Lawrence Davidson 
For those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. 
Back in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for “regime change” in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) 
For our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? 
The short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. 
But the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government’s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. 
What we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. 
So the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. 
On March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. 
Social and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? 
The various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out – specifically, how to tell when they are getting “true” intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need “ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. ” To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. 
A “partnership” is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a “ permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board” to coordinate programs in “social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .” 
Despite this effort, it is almost certain that the “social and behavioral sciences” cannot give the spy agencies what they want – a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. 
The Believers 
It is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth – that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) 
Therefore, if someone feeds them “snake oil,” they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors – those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview – have different criterion for what is “true” than do the analysts. 
Listen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council – yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, “ We’re looking for truth. But we’re particularly looking for truth that works. ” Now what might that mean? 
I can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, “truth” must match up, fit with, their worldview – their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not “work.” So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by “group think,” ideological blinkers, and a “we know better” attitude. 
On the other hand, as long as what you’re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory – the list is almost endless. 
What does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers – the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class – presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. 
It has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare’s determination that “what is past, is prelude.” Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will – no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.",1
3,15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified,Jessica Purkiss,"Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. 
The Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. 
The US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
The Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. 
Rais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. 
Rais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” 
The deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. 
The Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. 
On September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. 
The US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. 
At the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. 
In both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. 
The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations. Name",1
4,Iranian woman jailed for fictional unpublished story about woman stoned to death for adultery,Howard Portnoy,"Print 
An Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran’s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she’d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . 
Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. 
“When the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment – without a warrant – and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,” the article stated. 
“One of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery – never published, never presented to anyone,” the article stated. “The narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.",1

[In this week’s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie discusses the looming threat of North Korea, and explains how President Donald Trump could win the support of the Hollywood left if the U.

They’ll get nauseous. ” “[Trump] could win the left over, they’ll fall in love with him in a minute. If he bombed them for a better reason,” Jackie explains. “Like if they have no transgender toilets. ” Jackie also says it’s no surprise that Hollywood celebrities didn’t support Trump’s strike on a Syrian airfield this month. “They were infuriated,” he says. “Because it might only save lives. That doesn’t mean anything to them. If it only saved the environment, or climate change! They’d be the happiest people in the world. ” Still, Jackie says he’s got nothing against Hollywood celebs.

6,"Life: Life Of Luxury: Elton John’s 6 Favorite Shark Pictures To Stare At During Long, Transcontinental Flights",nan,"Ever wonder how Britain’s most iconic pop pianist gets through a long flight? Here are the six pictures of sharks Sir Elton John likes to stare at to pass the time on an airplane. 1. A Shark Swimming 
Sit next to Elton John on a flight and you’ll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. The platinum-selling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animal’s triumphant return. He will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. A Great White Shark Leaping Into The Air 
When you’re an international pop sensation worth an estimated $450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. Flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in Elton John’s seat-back pocket before he even boards the plane. The five-time Grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3-to-4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the shark’s beady eyes. 3. A Shark On The Prowl 
Rumor has it Elton John first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to London to perform “Candle In The Wind” at Princess Diana’s funeral. It’s been a staple of his travel routine ever since. Those who have flown with the music legend say that Sir Elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. Two Hammerhead Sharks 
How does the man behind “Tiny Dancer” and “Rocket Man” handle turbulence as his plane traverses the Atlantic? Once that “Fasten Seat Belts” sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. Elton John holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. The Poster For Jaws 
Sir Elton John absolutely adores the poster for Steven Spielberg’s Jaws and hopes to one day see the film. In the meantime, the British icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24-by-36-inch copy of the poster whenever he’s on a long flight, gently tracing the shark’s teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. Pilot’s Choice 
As much as Elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from London to a distant corner of Europe. That’s why all pilots who fly Sir Elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff. So yeah—it’s good to be Elton!",1
7,Benoît Hamon Wins French Socialist Party’s Presidential Nomination - The New York Times,Alissa J. Rubin,"PARIS  —   France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sunday’s primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Benoît Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would “make France’s heart beat,” bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls’s 41 percent. “Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,” Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. “Our country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,” he said. Mr. Hamon’s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President François Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamon’s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, François Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. France’s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   Mélenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollande’s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamon’s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollande’s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benoît Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. “We have a perspective we have something to do, to build,” Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollande’s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving France’s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). “We have someone that trusts us,” Mr. Kekenbosch said, “who says: ‘I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonald’s on provisional contracts for 4 years. ” Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.",0
8,Excerpts From a Draft Script for Donald Trump’s Q&ampA With a Black Church’s Pastor - The New York Times,nan,"Donald J. Trump is scheduled to make a highly anticipated visit to an   church in Detroit on Saturday, the first such visit of his campaign. There, he will participate in a    session conducted by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of the church, Great Faith Ministries International. Given the importance of the visit, the Trump team went so far as to script Mr. Trump’s answers to Bishop Jackson’s questions, which were submitted in advance. After this article was published on Thursday night, a campaign official said that Mr. Trump would also speak to the church’s congregation and then tour some neighborhoods with Ben Carson, a former presidential candidate and Detroit native. Below are excerpts from a draft of the script that was obtained by The New York Times. _____ Mr. Trump there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over. Case and point Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their Bible Study and slaughtered the Reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a race war. What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our Country? In the Bible Jesus said that a house divided cannot stand. Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a   society. In business, we hire, retain and award based on merit. In society, however, we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country. We have to reform our tax system so that we can spur economic growth for the long haul. We have to have stronger enforcement of immigration laws. We have to renegotiate our trade deals so that we can bring advantage back to the American workforce. But perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all Americans. The higher the educational attainment, the greater the likelihood one can climb the economic ladder. We must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get rid of Common Core. We must make sure that access, affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system. Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American, we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained. Republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done. We have to have the courage to go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that our children have access to the whatever educational situation they may need. This is not something one person can do, but it is something that we can do together. _____ Mr. Trump there is a perception that your administration is racist. With many of the African American voters their belief is that the Republican Party as a whole does not cater to African American needs. In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney and neither one of them came to Detroit, or any urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community. First I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican Candidate. Second I need to know how would you change that perception in our community? The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. Coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. We need to be true to our word and offer all Americans more opportunities so that each and every one of them can reach their full potential. This means economic policies that will bring jobs back to America and will raise wages for all. This means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children. This means cleaning up drugs and making our neighborhoods and communities safer. We need to get people off welfare and back to work. We need to make sure that anyone who qualifies can go into a bank, get a loan and then start a business. We need to reduce regulations and expand options for people who want to be independent of government. We need to make sure that people can worship how they want and where they want without worrying that some federal agency is going to threaten the religious liberties. Republicans have better options. We just need to have the courage to present them with conviction. _____ Mr. Trump what is your vision for America? And specifically Black America? If you repeal Obama care what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who can’t afford it, yet need it the most? As President, I must serve all Americans without regard to race, ethnicity or any other qualification. I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential. If we are to Make America Great Again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country. I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. Every individual, regardless of race or ethnicity, must have access to the full array of opportunities in America. My vision for America is that every citizen and legal resident of this nation will be able to stand side by side and be proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth. As for the Affordable Care Act, I will work to repeal the act and replace it with market driven solutions that will offer more access to healthcare at more affordable prices. Every American should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines, have health savings account that belong to them, have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best prices and know that they will not have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they are in this country illegally. We want to block grant Medicaid so that states can provide services closer to the people. We want to make sure that every American has great economic opportunity so that they can seek out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it. This approach will serve all Americans and will ensure that more Americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options. _____ Mr. Trump I am a registered Democrat but I am an undecided voter in this election for 2016. It is not only myself but there has been a lot of Pastors and African Americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for. The latest polls indicate that you have 1 percent of the African American vote. What can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the African American Community that will win our vote on November 8, 2016? And beyond winning, why is the African American vote important to you? All votes are important to me and my campaign. Your vote, your neighbor’s vote, the vote of every American is critical and I must do all I can to make sure you know that if you vote for me, you are voting for a stronger, more vibrant America. My policies offer you a clear choice. You can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that, unfortunately, includes far too many people of color. If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential. This is all about opportunity  —   not   outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize. The progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all Americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible. Education, jobs, religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that I will keep, not just utter to gain favor. If you are interested in a greater America with more opportunity, liberty and prosperity, you must take a chance and walk over to my side. If you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down. By the way, my support is now up to 8% and climbing.",0
9,"A Back-Channel Plan for Ukraine and Russia, Courtesy of Trump Associates - The New York Times",Megan Twohey and Scott Shane,"A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  —   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  —   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. “Who doesn’t want to help bring about peace?” Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  —   “names of companies, wire transfers”  —   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. “A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,” Mr. Artemenko said. “But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?” Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko “is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. ” At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against “appeasement” of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine’s expense  —   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko’s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trump’s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia’s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossier’s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine’s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “It’s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. “Our time has come!” Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  —   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. “It is a gross violation of the Constitution,” he said in written answers to questions from The Times. “Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. ” The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko’s project also includes the dissemination of “kompromat,” or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko’s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater “were sitting in the room right now,” Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, “I really wouldn’t know what he looked like. ” But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. “I want to stop a war, number one,” he said. “Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. ” After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. “Fraud is never good, right?” Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn’s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.",0
10,Obama’s Organizing for Action Partners with Soros-Linked ‘Indivisible’ to Disrupt Trump’s Agenda,Aaron Klein,"Organizing for Action, the activist group that morphed from Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for “online trainings” on how to protest President Donald Trump’s agenda. [Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, “Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. ”  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama’s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as “advocate[ing] for the president’s policies. ” In a recent Facebook post titled, “Take a deep breath. Then take action,” OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. “Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,” the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner “Indivisible,” advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and “grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. ” Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host’s positions. “This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. ” It also urges them to ask “hostile” questions  —   while keeping “a firm hold on the mic”  —   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isn’t “giving you real answers. ” “Express your concern [to the event’s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,” it says.   …    “Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,” the document states, “because these actions create the impression that they’re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. ” Sperry reported OFA “plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare’s repeal. ” Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFA’s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama’s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  —   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  —   and a deputy campaign manager.   …    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisible’s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine’s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that “conservatives” are “spreading unfounded rumors” that the group is “being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. ” Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet’s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed “Indivisible,” the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump’s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have “signed up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. ” The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The group’s website states: “What’s more, you all are putting the guide into action —  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. You’re resisting —  and it’s working. ” Politico reported on “unfounded” rumors being spread about Soros’s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): “It doesn’t matter who we take money from  —   we’re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we don’t take money from Soros,” said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. “That’s one of the attacks and that’s fine. ” While “Indivisible” has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politico’s claim about “unfounded rumors” that Indivisibles’ success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trump’s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padilla’s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisible’s ties to the organizers of last month’s   Women’s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Women’s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Women’s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

11,Ryan Lochte Dropped by Speedo USA and Other Retailers - The New York Times,Katie Rogers,"The fallout from Ryan Lochte’s story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio  —   a tale the Brazilian police said was not true  —   continued Monday when four companies said they would end business partnerships with Mr. Lochte, an American swimmer and   Olympic medalist. After a week of intense international media attention and anger in Brazil, the financial repercussions were swift for Mr. Lochte as Speedo USA, the luxury clothing retailer Ralph Lauren and the mattress company Airweave all announced that they would part ways with him. And Syneron Candela, a company that sells   devices, told Reuters its relationship with the swimmer ended on Sunday. Speedo USA said in a message on Twitter that it would instead donate a $50, 000 portion of Mr. Lochte’s fee to a charity to help Brazilian children. “While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for,” the company said in its statement. On Monday, Kim Angelastro, a spokeswoman for Syneron Candela, wrote in an email, “We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners. ” Mr. Lochte was a spokesman for the company’s Gentle Hair Removal brand. Through a spokeswoman, Ralph Lauren said Monday that Mr. Lochte’s endorsement agreement with the clothing company had been for only the 2016 Olympics, and that his contract would not be renewed. Airweave said on Twitter that “after careful consideration, we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte. ” The decisions to cut ties with Mr. Lochte, 32, were the first major signs of the financial fallout for him. For the past week, he has been at the center of an international firestorm after the Brazilian police said he and three other American athletes  —   Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz  —   had fabricated the account of being robbed after a   party in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities said that the swimmers had instead drunkenly vandalized a gas station bathroom, paying a security guard about $50 for the damage before leaving. Mr. Lochte originally said that the car they were traveling in had been stopped by armed men, who held a gun to his head. But his story later changed. A Brazilian judge ordered the swimmers to remain in Rio, but Mr. Lochte had already left the country. After Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz were pulled from their flight to the United States, they told the police that the confrontation began when Lochte pulled a poster off a gas station wall. Mr. Feigen, 26, later donated $10, 800 to a charity in Rio that teaches martial arts to poor children. Mr. Lochte first issued an apology on social media  —   “I should have been much more responsible for how I handled myself,” he wrote  —   then told Matt Lauer in an interview on NBC that he had been intoxicated and that he had “overexaggerated that story. ” He has maintained that he was held at gunpoint. “All we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction, and we were demanded to give money,” Mr. Lochte said. Mr. Lochte, whose boyish and sometimes oafish personality had made him a commercial success in Olympics past, had headed into Rio with fewer sponsors than he’d had at the London Games, according to a report by CNN Money. Mr. Lochte took home a gold medal in the   freestyle relay in Rio.",0

“And I do not need every newspaper in Britain muttering words like ‘Compton’ and ‘ghetto’ like a horrendously prejudiced grandparent. Especially as I already have a horrendously prejudiced grandparent. 
“Stop saying I could do better. You might think so, but by any realistic measure she’s already way out of my league, okay?”

13,Conservatives Urge Sessions to Clean Out Obama’s Civil Rights Division - Breitbart,Ian Mason,"A group of attorneys, scholars, and advocates put their names to a letter sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday, urging him to take a serious look at reform as he works with the President to select a new Assistant Attorney General for his Civil Rights Division. [“During the Obama administration, the Division served purely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices. Entrenched federal bureaucrats jettisoned precepts like equal enforcement in favor of political and racialized dogmas with a zeal that risks litigation failure and invites court sanctions,” the letter states.  Signed by such conservative heavyweights as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the letter paints a picture of a Division ripe for sweeping reform after eight years under Obama during which “The Civil Rights Division has relegated its leadership role to political activists. ” Hiring practices for the career staff of the Division is one of the letter’s chief concerns. While Tom Perez, now head of the Democratic National Committee, was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, the Division was the subject of an Inspector General’s review that found the Obama Justice Department’s insistence that   have a “demonstrated commitment to civil rights” led to a perception only   activists need apply. “In this case, perception and reality were synonymous,” the letter insists, noting instances in which Division employees leaked confidential information to civil rights groups, and Perez’s subsequent refusal to implement any of the report’s hiring recommendations. Also among the letter’s complaints is the alleged culture of politically motivated bullying that was fostered during the Obama years. The same Inspector General’s Report found a pattern of personal attacks against, for example, employees who were “openly Christian. ” J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and a signatory of the letter, added, “For years, a radicalized Civil Rights Division   advanced leftists causes with respect to voting, law enforcement, immigration, and others while constitutional Rule of Law was considered a nuisance. General Sessions has an opportunity to begin the course correction necessary to protect all Americans from civil rights abuses. ” In picking a new head for the Civil Rights Division, the letter’s signatories hope Attorney General Sessions will look for a reformer prepared to return to   civil rights enforcement and tackle the Division’s entrenched cultural problems. “The next AAG certainly cannot be a proponent of the status quo by any means,” they say.",0
14,Internal Inquiry Sealed the Fate of Roger Ailes at Fox - The New York Times,"Jim Rutenberg, Ben Protess and Emily Steel","Executives at 21st Century Fox decided to end the tenure of Roger Ailes after lawyers they hired to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against him took statements from at least six other women who described inappropriate behavior from Mr. Ailes, two people briefed on the inquiry said Wednesday. One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailes’s reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture. The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailes’s exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr. Ailes’s service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant. But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly supported him. The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and not the broader climate at the network. But Mr. Ailes’s departure will have much wider implications. Given Fox News’s place as a central hub for conservative opinion  —   not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump  —   the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for the national political dialogue. In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct, and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well. The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailes’s current management team. That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the network, which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media. Speculation about who Mr. Ailes’s successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr. Ailes’s current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc. At least for the day, fears that some of Fox News’s   stars, like Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailes’s loss of his chairmanship, appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network. She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr. Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday. Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr. Ailes’s chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named. In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a woman’s appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom. The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said. As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network. The swift pace of events at Fox News  —   only two weeks passed between Ms. Carlson’s filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailes’s leadership  —   were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing “politically incorrect” themes, something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a network trademark. To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network. And 21st Century Fox’s leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network. Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation  —   and perhaps even some deference  —   to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch.

Lebanon has a new president. The political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country. On Monday, lawmakers voted to pick General Michel Aoun as Lebanon’s 13th president. The election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement Hezbollah, especially after Saad Hariri, the leader of the March 14 Alliance and a close ally of Saudi Arabia, voiced his support for Aoun. On this edition of ‘The Debate,’ Press TV has asked two analysts why they believe Hariri threw his weight behind Aoun. 
Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, praised Hariri’s measure, adding that with this decision, he actually wanted to bring stability back to Lebanon and thus avoid Syria’s spillover effects. 
Hariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the Lebanese society, Mikhail said, adding that by his vote for General Aoun, he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and, ultimately, save it from the repercussions of the Syrian war. 
Mikhail believes that the United States’ shrinking power in the Middle East has forced Hariri to face away from Washington. 
“I believe that Saad Hariri could have been motivated, along with others, about a vision that America’s role in the Middle East is receding. So, perhaps Russia is the new reality in the Middle East, is a new power. So, anything that is somehow close to Russia will be better for Lebanon,” Mikhail argued. 
Mikhail said that “so many things have transpired inside Lebanon and inside the Arab region within this year. I would assume that the Syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the [Persian] Gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities.” 
“He (Hariri) sees that Syria has to be stable in order for Lebanon to be stable. So, he is making calculations. I hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe. So, he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his Syrian interests and [Persian] Gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this.” The image grab shows Gordon Duff (L), a senior editor of Veterans Today based in Ohio, and Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, at Press TV’s ‘The Debate’ show on Monday night. 
Meanwhile, the other guest on the show, Gordon Duff, the editor of Veterans Today , noted that, in his view, the reason behind Hezbollah’s victory in Michel Aoun’s election is the movement’s victories in Syria, especially in Aleppo, which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories. 
“If Aleppo falls, and Aleppo will fall, it’s only a matter of how long, a victorious and highly-disciplined, highly-trained Hezbollah force, [which is] heavily trained by Russia and by Iran, is going to return to Lebanon. It’s a very different force and I believe Hariri is looking at this. Reaching out for what should be a very different Hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in Lebanon that has been out of control,” Duff reiterated. Related Posts:",1
16,"СМИ Сербии приписали россиянам ""подготовку терактов"" в Черногории",nan,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
Однако глава правительства Сербии Александр Вучич отказался комментировать сообщения о высланных россиянах. ""Не все в вашем вопросе неверно, одна часть не точна. Я не хотел вам отвечать не только по той причине, которую уже назвал, но и еще из-за одной вещи — потому, что об этих делах я говорить не имею права по закону"", — сказал Вучич белградскому телеканалу N1. 
Новость о депортации российских граждан совпала с неожиданным приездом в Белград секретаря Совбеза РФ Николая Патрушева. Сербские эксперты убеждены, что главная цель визита — обсуждение ситуации в Черногории. Как сообщает ""Коммерсантъ"", ссылаясь на близких к правительству Сербии источников, Белград не заинтересован в таком скандале, но и не хочет быть заподозренным в причастности к неким ""террористическим акциям"". 
Во время своего визита Николай Патрушев встретился со всем руководством республики: 26 октября — с президентом Томиславом Николичем и главой МИДа Ивицей Дачичем, а 27 октября — с премьером Александром Вучичем. Все переговоры прошли в строго закрытом режиме. В самом начале визита было официально объявлено, что Патрушев предложил сербским властям подписать меморандум о взаимопонимании в области безопасности, который создал бы постоянный канал связи между Москвой и Белградом в этой сфере. 
Однако профессор факультета безопасности Белградского университета Зоран Драгишич уверен, что визит связан с тем, что произошло в соседней Черногории, где власти объявили о предотвращении террористических акций в день выборов. Этой же точки зрения придерживается сербский военный эксперт Александр Радич. Источник ""Ъ"" близкий к правительству Сербии считает, что ""российский гость наверняка хотел бы прояснить наши шаги по сотрудничеству с Черногорией в расследовании активности групп, готовивших беспорядки в Подгорице 16 октября"". 
Напомним, 16 октября в Черногории состоялись парламентские выборы . В день голосования Власти страны объявили о задержании 20 граждан Сербии по подозрению в подготовке теракта и путча. По предварительным данным, группа планировала напасть на собравшихся перед зданием парламента граждан и полицейских, занять помещения скупщины с целью провозгласить победу одной из политических партий, лишить свободы премьер-министра Черногории. Утверждается, что лидером организации был экс-начальник жандармерии Сербии Братислав ""Бато"" Дикич. 
Спустя несколько дней сербский премьер Вучич сообщил, что службы безопасности страны задержали ряд лиц, организовавших слежку за премьером Черногории. 
Напомним, на парламентских выборах в Черногории победила прозападная Демократическая партия социалистов (ДПС) премьер-министра Мило Джукановича. 
Как рассказал ранее Pravda.Ru специалист Института европейских исследований Стеван Гайич, ""даже если бы оппозиция признала выборы, разница между оппозицией и пронатовской партией Джукановича — только в одном или двух депутатах. Так что Джуканович далеко не победил. Джуканович провел эти выборы в атмосфере государственного переворота, во время выборов были выключены Viber и WhatsApp. Оппозиция впервые за 27 лет сказала: хватит, не будем больше признавать нелегитимные выборы, потому что одним и тем же образом Джуканович приобретает власть из года в год и уже 27 лет он находится практически в режиме абсолютного диктатора страны"". 
Можно предполагать, что и сообщения о подготовке ""террористических актов"" могут быть частью политической борьбы в Черногории - с учетом того, что от власти Мило Джуканович отказываться явно не собирается.

17,"Samsung, After Combustible Galaxy Note 7, Unveils New Smartphone - The New York Times",Brian X. Chen,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Dogged by combustible smartphones and recalls of other devices, Samsung Electronics is hoping to find a path to product redemption. The South Korean company on Wednesday introduced the Galaxy S8, its first major smartphone release since the scandal over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were discontinued last year after some of the devices spontaneously caught fire. “It’s been a challenging year for Samsung,” said D. J. Koh, the company’s head of mobile devices, adding that Samsung was ready to start anew. The Galaxy S8 features a large 5.  screen without adding bulk to the device. The company said it made room for the screen by reducing the size of the bezel  —   or the forehead and the chin  —   on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display. With the Galaxy S8, Samsung also rolled out its virtual assistant, Bixby, to rival Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Similar to previous virtual assistants, Bixby responds to voice commands. Time  —   and sales  —   will tell whether the Galaxy S8 will restore confidence in Samsung’s smartphones. Last year, after the company received dozens of complaints about the Galaxy Note 7 overheating, and in some cases exploding, the company recalled the phones. But replacement phones continued to catch fire, and the company had to recall the devices a second time before killing the product altogether, sacrificing billions of dollars in revenue. The Galaxy Note 7 may still make a reappearance. On Monday, Samsung said that it might sell refurbished versions of the phone. Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research, said the Galaxy S8 could help Samsung recover as long as the product worked reliably. “Note 7 definitely did some damage to the Samsung brand, especially for people who had little or no personal experience with Samsung devices,” he said. “But as long as the S8 does well and doesn’t suffer from any of the same problems, the memories of the Note 7 issues will fade and Samsung will recover well.” Samsung last year also issued a separate recall for 2. 8 million washing machines in the United States. The machines were prone to detaching from the washing machine chassis, posing a risk of injury. The Galaxy S8 will arrive in stores next month with a starting price of $750.",0
18,Poland Vows Referendum on Migrant Quota Amidst EU Pressure: ’The Public’s Voice Will Be Heard’ - Breitbart,Virginia Hale,"“The public’s voice will be heard,” Poland’s president declared, as he vowed a referendum on the European Union’s (EU) migrant quota amidst growing pressure from Brussels. [Describing the question of whether Poland should be forced to accept a quota of migrants from the third world as “of vital importance” for its future security, Andrzej Duda said the referendum could be held during parliamentary elections in 2019.  “That would allow the new government to hear the clear voice of the nation on the issue,” said the president. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government’s position on the quota system is “clear and unambiguous” Duda said. He said maintaining the party “does not agree with the [plan] and asserted that “Poland does not consent to the forced relocation of refugees on our territory”. Holding a referendum will also enable the public’s voice to be heard over the voices of international organisations, Duda asserted. “If Brussels continues to raise [the issue of migration] attempting to exert pressure and force on the Polish authorities, then public opinion will be extremely important,” Duda promised. Poland’s latest display of opposition to the redistribution plan comes as the Czech Republic announced its withdrawal from the scheme, which has been fiercely contested in Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary and Slovakia challenging the plans in court. In an interview with Czech tabloid Blesk published Tuesday, EU president   Juncker demanded all nations in Europe shoulder “solidarity and responsibility” when it comes to migration. Brussels was left humiliated last year when Hungarians were asked what they thought of EU plans to force on their nation migrants from the third world, as 95 per cent said they rejected the scheme. Earlier this month, Breitbart London reported that senior Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki announced the “only proven method” to avoid Islamist terror attacks is not to import Muslim migrants. “When it comes to reducing the chances of Poland being hit by [Islamist] terror attacks, the only proven method is to not allow in Muslim migrants,” the MEP told local radio after the London Bridge terror attack, which killed eight and injured at least 48 others.",0
19,Sparking An Inner Revolution,Lance Schuttler,"0 0 With humanity’s awakening continuing to speed up as every day passes, we see more and more people desiring information to help them better themselves. Whether that is done through eating healthier foods, beginning a yoga or meditation practice, or whether it is done by being more mindful with the words they choose to use when having an inner dialogue or a conversation with friends and family, more people are looking for information to help them transform their lives in a positive way. While there are many methods to improving one’s life, below are some methods that can help a person spark an inner revolution to create positive and uplifting change in his or her world. Grounding/Earthing Grounding, or what is also called Earthing is when a person has bare skin touching the Earth or a tree and is most commonly done by standing on the Earth with one’s bare feet. Doing this begins to balance the electrochemical state of the body because of the negative ions the Earth emits. Negative ions act as antioxidants (free-radical scavengers) by pairing up with the free radicals and rendering them neutral. Thus, pain, inflammation and anything out of balance begins to move towards balance, or homeostasis. There have been several studies that have shown how grounding helps with pain reduction, wounding healing, balancing of the circadian rhythm to help improve sleep, as well as helping to shift a person’s brainwaves to the alpha state, which is great for a calm and balanced, yet alert and fully awake state of mind. Standing barefoot on the Earth, sand, dirt or concrete (not asphalt) will allow the free flow of negative ions to come in contact with the sensory neurons on the skin and begin to trigger positive physiological and psychological changes within the body. Taking it a bit further, if a person is able to connect with the Earth in a quiet place, the benefits could be even more as Dr. Joe Dispenza has said , “In clinical studies, we have proven that 2 hours of nature sounds a day significantly reduce stress hormones up to 800% and activates 500-600 DNA segments known to be responsible for healing and repairing the body.” Burning Sage In a 2007 study from the Journal of Ethnopharmacology , researchers found that medicinal smoke killed harmful airborne bacteria by up to 94% in just one hour. On a more spiritual level, burning sage has long been used to clear negative or disharmonious energies from a space. This can be done when a person comes home from work or school for that day, as burning sage can be a good way to clear any discordant energy the person may have “picked up” or had “taken on” from other people or their environment. It is used to clear away such energy so that a person can be centered in who he or she is, rather than having to deal with issues that might have been taken on from others. I personally do this each time after coming home from getting groceries or running and errand. Essential Oils The two best ways to use essential oils are to smell them as well as apply them to the skin. While applying essential oils to the skin has many of it’s own benefits, smelling them also creates wonderful responses in the body, and especially the brain. According to the University of Minnesota , smelling essential oils’ molecules affect the olfactory organs, the lungs (and thus the respiratory system) as well as the brain. Odor molecules travel through the nose and positively affect the limbic system of the brain, which is sometimes called the “emotional part of the brain.” To this end, the limbic system controls heart rate, mood, blood pressure, memory, breathing, stress hormone response and overall stress levels. Applying or smelling essential oils throughout the day is a wonderful way to develop emotional intelligence and can help a person respond to stressful situations in a more positive way than before. Smelling essential oils can be personally described as an uplifting and heavenly experience; one that allows us to smell the cosmic byproduct of thousands of flowers pressed into a wonderful gift for humanity. Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises, which can also be considered a form of meditation, can have profound effects on the body and mind. According to Deepok Chopra , a regular practice of rhythmic deep breathing has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, stabilize blood pressure, increase energy levels and decrease feelings of stress. Over time, a breathing or meditation practice can lead to wonderful internal shifts both physically and emotionally. Incorporating a deep breathing practice into the practice of grounding or Earthing is a great way to accomplish both practices at once. Here is an article of three sample breathing exercises from Dr. Andrew Weil. While there are many other practices a person can use to help catalyze deeper inner growth, such as flower essence therapy (different from essential oils), nature walking, sun-bathing and the use of certain health supplements like fulvic acid and Reishi , this list is a guide that may help those who may just be starting to experience an internal transformation. These four simple practices can be easy to incorporate into one’s life and is recommended to experiment with what feels best for that person. What of these practices do you use in your life? What other practices do you use to help you continue your inner revolution? Share with us your practices or suggestions you have in the comments section. Cheers to our health!

20,Dueling Drills Further Increase NATO Russia Tensions,nan,"Dueling Drills Further Increase NATO Russia Tensions November 03, 2016 Dueling Drills Further Increase NATO Russia Tensions 
Irked by NATO's disaster-relief drills in Montenegro, Russia held special forces exercises with its Balkan neighbour Serbia on Wednesday. In Montenegro, which split from Serbia a decade ago, NATO is on Friday due to wrap up a five-day disaster-relief drill of 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO members and 10 partner countries including Serbia. ""It is in the interest of Montenegro, in the interest of NATO, and also in the interest of the region, to be part of NATO and promote Euro-Atlantic values in the Balkans, and these values benefit each and every one of us,"" Montenegro's deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic , said about the exercise. Across the border, in Serbia, Russia flew in its paratroopers along with allied Belarus for an exercise called ""Slavic Brotherhood"", which according the Serbian defence ministry focuses on ""fighting terrorism"". 
The drills are set to last until November 9 and will include 212 Russian, 450 Serbian and 56 Belarusian troops. Three Russian transport planes have already landed in Belgrade on Wednesday bringing in soldiers and equipment. 
Drills in the two former Yugoslav republics reflect mounting tensions between Russia and the West over a variety of geopolitical issues including conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.

In Serbia, NATO is hugely unpopular after its 1999 bombing ousted Belgrade's armed forces out of its former southern province of Kosovo. 
But as part of its integrations with the West, Serbia last year signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP), the highest level of cooperation between NATO and a country not aspiring to join. 
An EU candidate, Serbia insists that it is militarily neutral, but maintains close ties with Russia, its Orthodox Christian and Slavic superpower ally, the biggest gas and oil source and an obstacle to Kosovo's membership in the United Nations. 
Last year Montenegro accepted an invitation to join NATO, a move that soured relations withRussia. Ahead of October's parliamentary vote Montenegro's outgoing Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic accused Moscow of meddling in country's elections and of financing the opposition. A fifth of the votes in the poll went to an anti-NATO, pro-Serbia bloc. Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

21,Study: More Than Half of Car Crashes Involve Drivers Distracted by Cell Phones - Breitbart,Nate Church,"A new study found that 52% of roadside accidents involved drivers distracted by their phones. [Apparently, being in sole control of one of the   aluminum shells hurtling at high speed on America’s roads isn’t enough to hold drivers’ attention. Traffic deaths have jumped by 14% since 2014, according to Cambridge Mobile Telematics, which conducted the study. The research firm found that 52% of accidents involved drivers who were distracted by their phones.    phone use while driving laws have done little to curb the habits of its citizens. Only fourteen states have banned handheld use of phones while driving, and only twenty prohibit phone use by school bus drivers a single state bans bus drivers from texting. But Cambridge Mobile Telematics’ Chief Technology Officer, Hari Balakrishnan, has hope: Distracted driving due to smartphone use is intuitively blamed for the increase in road crashes and claims. What’s less intuitive is that smartphones hold the solution to the problem they created. Drivers now have access to tools that analyze their driving and achieve real behavioral change through immediate and ongoing feedback. Balakrishnan called distracted driving “one of the most urgent public safety problems facing our communities today” and stressed the importance of taking a “critical look at how we can most effectively reduce the danger that drivers face. ” CMT is working to do their part. Their DriveWell app both monitors drivers and encourages safer driving habits. The site claims that “users see an average reduction of 35% in phone distraction, 20% in hard braking, and 20% in   speeding all within less than 30 days of using the program. ” Their goals are best summed up by Balakrishnan himself: “By harnessing the very technology that threatens driver safety, and using it to help drivers understand and improve their behavior, we’re making the world safer by the day. ” Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.",0

This article will not be a pro-Trump or a pro-Hillary piece. It will have little to do with politics and more to do with a much bigger picture. As everyone knows, many people are celebrating the Trump victory and many people are mourning it. What is needed right now is a wider perspective at what is occurring. Donald Trump will become the next U.S. President. 
With Donald Trump set to take over the Oval Office in late January of 2017, there are many unknowns, just as it would be if Hillary would have won. 
What is going to happen with health insurance? What is going to happen with immigration laws? What is going to happen with foreign policy in relation to other nations? More importantly, what is going to happen to us as individuals and humanity as a whole? 
Individual Healing 
While these questions need to be asked and will in time be answered, we must remember that we cannot give up our personal power to shape our individual lives. Right now, many people are worried and many people are thrilled. Regardless of our feelings on this election, we must remember that we alone are responsible for our individual lives as we make countless choices each day. How will I choose to treat others today? How will I choose to treat myself today? Am I taking care of my physical body well by eating well and exercising enough? Am I ensuring to get enough sleep throughout the week? What is it I can do today to become a better person? By either believing that one person is going to save or change your entire life or by believing that one person is going to ruin your entire life gives away your own personal power. The great philosopher Epictetus once said , “It is not what happens to you, it is how you respond.” We always have a choice in our response to any situation. 
By either being saddened or thrilled at the perception that one man is going to either ruin or save your life is extremely dis-empowering. Though each person has every right to feel how they want, it must be remembered where true power comes from: within . Every person has the choice how they wish to respond to this election. Are you going to wither away in frustration, anger and despair or are you going to make choices that help you to become the best person you can be? On the opposite side, are you going to sit back and believe your personal challenges are going to be fixed with a new president or are you also going to take action to become the best person you can be? Regardless of who you did or didn’t support, we all need to reclaim our personal power and continue the trek towards bettering and healing ourselves, even if it is in the smallest of ways. 
Collective Healing 
On a wider scale, this election will give us the collective choice to where we wish to travel. Do we wish to seek peace with other people and other countries? Do we wish to have dialogue with nations previous administrations demonized? Do we wish to communicate with and try to understand other people’s viewpoints or are we going to remain closed off to such opportunities for personal and collective healing and growth? 
Additionally, are we going to continue to allow group-think to dominate our society by letting the media tell us what to believe, or are we going to begin gathering information from several sources to arrive at our own conclusions? Are we going to question our leaders more and demand answers that are truthful and unbiased towards any specific agenda? Will we do this both on a local and mass level? Are we going to work towards cooperation or continue to live in a dying paradigm of competition? 
As physicist and author Gregg Braden says , “A growing body of scientific evidence, gathered from more than 400 peer-reviewed studies, is leading to an undeniable truth: violent competition and war directly contradict our deepest instincts of cooperation and nurturing. Scientific studies show conclusively that nature is based upon a model of cooperation and mutual aid, not violent competition and war. We live in a world where everything is connected. We can no longer think in terms of us and them when it comes to the consequences of the way we live. Today it’s all about WE .” Science has disproved Darwin’s theory and shows us we must act in unison to transcend our collective challenges. 
I see this election as many other do: a massive turning point in our world’s evolution. I personally have full trust that we will look back at this time and see this as a positive, yet challenging event in that it empowered more people to begin taking action to create the kind of world they wish to live in. This turning point is allowing us all to shift our perception of the world and to initiate action towards creating a more peaceful, happy and abundant world for all.

26,Cognition and True Islam - A Book Review,M.R. Islam,"1 Shares

Book Review – Dr. Rafiq Islam, Emertec R&D Ltd; Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia
 Book title: True Islam, Jihad, and Terrorism: The Science of Islamic Foreign Policy – Jaan S. Islam
 Publisher: New York: Nova Science Publishers
 ISBN 978-1-63485-542-6.
 At a time of politics of fear, Jaan Islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece, True Islam, Jihad and Terrorism (Nova Science Publishers, New York, 2016). During the 2016 US election, it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of Islam and how it is understood in today’s context. This is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about Islamic history, philosophy, and political science. This book presents the Islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great Muslim thinkers and scholars such as Ibn Khaldun. Jaan Islam uses the so-called ‘Islamic cognition technique’ and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to Islamic cognition. This chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields. Such an extension was first pointed by Islam, Zatzman and Islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum.
MORE... Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality, integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere: The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars, Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources, Qur'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-Orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven ‘research’ about Islamic history. The distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value.
 Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. It is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . Quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition. It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. The west does recognize Averröes, the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands Islam as just another religion, similar to Christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. It is no surprise that with that starting point, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west.
Chapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely Hobbes, Locke and Ibn Khaldun. In this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is Ibn Khaldun’s political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke. Ibn Khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. The author points out how Ibn Khaldun’s first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Qur’an as the origin and prophet Muhammad’s life (through the book of Hadith) as the pivotal point. One the other hand, Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point. The author makes it clear that both Hobbes’ and Locke’s cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. In my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun.
In Chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as Rashedun Caliphs). Clearly, the author’s intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Qur’an they were enacting. For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Qur’an. No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time.
Similar to Chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5. Once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter.
In Chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life. The author makes it clear that Islam didn’t leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. This is not an easy topic to cover even in today’s world. The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic.
Often when Islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. If it is all that simple, why don’t Islamic scholars have consensus? The author handles this topic like a pro. In Chapter 7, he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist ‘scholars’ that have done great disservice to Islam and/or scientific cognition process. One doesn’t have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. To anyone’s surprise, this list is not made out of anti-Islamic non-Muslim scholars.
Chapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. The author analyzes every major event of today’s political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies, such as Saudi Arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws. This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments.
Chapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. It is important to read the book in sequence.
Chapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive.
Chapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation.
Anyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. Quite interestingly, the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam. Without the roof, the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever. This depiction captures the essence of protection, security, as well as integrity and puts away the notion of Jihad being a weapon for Crusade like aggression.
This book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about Islam or what Islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word, Islam that means peace through submission to the creator. This book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in today’s world. In this sense, this book is a manual for world governance in peace.",1

Are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time? 

From Michael Snyder : 
Because as I will show in this article, that is precisely what it is going to take in order for Donald Trump to win. Before I go any further, I want to make it exceedingly clear that I am not saying what the outcome will be on November 8th. As I recently told a national television audience, I do not know who is going to win. 
In this article I am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand. But in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight, and it is entirely possible that we could still have another “October surprise” or two before it is all said and done. And without a doubt Donald Trump desperately needs something “to move the needle”, because if the election was held today Hillary Clinton would almost certainly win. 
What we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented. Just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time. 
We have never had a bigger “October surprise” than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which Donald Trump claimed to grope women without their consent. 
We have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked Donald Trump. In the past, the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced, but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity. 
They should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves, and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back. 
We have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election. It has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall, and a whole host of prominent Republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the Trump campaign. 
If Donald Trump is able to overcome all of these factors, it truly will be a miracle of Biblical proportions. 
As it stands at the moment, however, the numbers are looking quite ominous for Trump. Right now, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls has Hillary Clinton ahead by 6.2 percent. Most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game. 
But even if Trump can close that gap and pull ahead, that does not mean that he will win the election. In fact, Trump could beat Clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose. 
In order to win the election, one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes. And on the latest Real Clear Politics electoral map, 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to Hillary Clinton, 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to Donald Trump, and 112 electoral votes are in the “toss up” category. 
So unless something dramatically changes, Donald Trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win, and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim. 
Let’s take a closer look at this. The first thing that Donald Trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. That would get him up to 206 electoral votes. 
Unfortunately, it looks like that may be very difficult to do. Romney won North Carolina, but the six most recent polls all have Clinton ahead in that state. Romney also won Arizona, but the most recent poll to be taken there has Clinton ahead by five points. 
But for a moment, let’s assume that Trump can win all of the states that Romney won. On top of that, there are four other states that Trump must win… 
#1 Trump must win Florida’s 29 electoral votes. Without Florida, Trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes. So on election night if it is announced that Trump has lost Florida, you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because Trump is going to lose the election. 
Unfortunately for Trump, four recent major surveys all show Trump down by four points in the Sunshine state. 
#2 Trump must win Ohio’s 18 electoral votes. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, and the two most recent major surveys show that Trump and Clinton are tied in the state. 
#3 Trump must win Iowa’s 6 electoral votes. Fortunately for Trump, most recent surveys show him actually leading in Iowa. 
#4 Trump must win Nevada’s 6 electoral votes. At this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do, because all of the recent polls have Clinton leading in Nevada, including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points. 
If Donald Trump can win those four states, that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes. Instead, it gets him to 265 electoral votes, and so he would still need one more medium-sized state to win. 
The most likely candidates for that last state are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota. Unfortunately for Trump, Clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment. 
But even if Trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark, the truth is that Utah could still mess everything up. 
Do you remember Evan McMullin? 
He was the third party “conservative alternative” candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards. 
He is only on the ballot in 12 states, but one of those states is Utah, and it turns out that Evan McMullin is a Mormon. 
Many Mormons believe that a Mormon will be elected president someday when the U.S. Constitution hangs “like a thread“. According to this belief, this Mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen. Many Mormons thought that Mitt Romney was going to be this president, but now Evan McMullin has become the target of these expectations. 
So how in the world could Evan McMullin become president? 
Well, their plan is to have Evan McMullin win Utah, and that could potentially keep both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close. If that happens, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives. 
It is being projected that the House will still be controlled by the Republicans after this election, and so the choice would come down to either Trump or McMullin, and those backing McMullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario. 
I know all of this sounds very strange, but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over Utah tonight. 
And in recent days Evan McMullin has been soaring in Utah. One recent survey shows Trump with a one point lead over McMullin, and another recent survey actually show McMullin leading Trump by four points in the state. 
So Trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes, and Utah could end up messing up everything for him. 
In addition, it is also very important to keep in mind that Trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud. There was widespread evidence of “funny business” in 2012, and this is something that I detailed for a live studio audience down at Morningsideearlier this month… 
Are you starting to see why I would consider this to be the biggest miracle in American political history if Donald Trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election? 
And we don’t have to wait until November 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go. Early voting is already taking place is some states, and so far the signs are not encouraging for the Trump campaign. The following comes from CNN… 
Democratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots. 
Perhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509. 
But if you do want Trump to win, the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before November 8th. 
We have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election, and a miracle is definitely not out of the question. 
In fact, I am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early November. So hold on to your hats, because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us.",1
28,Mindful Eating as Way to Fight Bingeing - The New York Times,Jeff Gordinier,"Editors’ note: We’re resurfacing this 2012 article for Smarter Living. Now sit down, take a deep breath and really savor that Christmas cookie. TRY this: place a forkful of food in your mouth. It doesn’t matter what the food is, but make it something you love  —   let’s say it’s that first nibble from three hot, fragrant, perfectly cooked ravioli. Now comes the hard part. Put the fork down. This could be a lot more challenging than you imagine, because that first bite was very good and another immediately beckons. You’re hungry. Today’s experiment in eating, however, involves becoming aware of that reflexive urge to plow through your meal like Cookie Monster on a shortbread bender. Resist it. Leave the fork on the table. Chew slowly. Stop talking. Tune in to the texture of the pasta, the flavor of the cheese, the bright color of the sauce in the bowl, the aroma of the rising steam. Continue this way throughout the course of a meal, and you’ll experience the    pleasures and frustrations of a practice known as mindful eating. The concept has roots in Buddhist teachings. Just as there are forms of meditation that involve sitting, breathing, standing and walking, many Buddhist teachers encourage their students to meditate with food, expanding consciousness by paying close attention to the sensation and purpose of each morsel. In one common exercise, a student is given three raisins, or a tangerine, to spend 10 or 20 minutes gazing at, musing on, holding and patiently masticating. Lately, though, such experiments of the mouth and mind have begun to seep into a secular arena, from the Harvard School of Public Health to the California campus of Google. In the eyes of some experts, what seems like the simplest of acts  —   eating slowly and genuinely relishing each bite  —   could be the remedy for a   Paula Deen Nation in which an endless parade of new diets never seems to slow a stampede toward obesity. Mindful eating is not a diet, or about giving up anything at all. It’s about experiencing food more intensely  —   especially the pleasure of it. You can eat a cheeseburger mindfully, if you wish. You might enjoy it a lot more. Or you might decide, halfway through, that your body has had enough. Or that it really needs some salad. “This is ” said Dr. Jan Chozen Bays, a pediatrician and meditation teacher in Oregon and the author of “Mindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food. ” “I think the fundamental problem is that we go unconscious when we eat. ” The last few years have brought a spate of books, blogs and videos about   eating. A Harvard nutritionist, Dr. Lilian Cheung, has devoted herself to studying its benefits, and is passionately encouraging corporations and health care providers to try it. At the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, Prof. Brian Wansink, the author of “Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think,” has conducted scores of experiments on the psychological factors that lead to our bottomless bingeing. A mindful lunch hour recently became part of the schedule at Google, and   gurus like Oprah Winfrey and Kathy Freston have become cheerleaders for the practice. With the annual   of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Super Bowl Sunday behind us, and Lent coming, it’s worth pondering whether mindful eating is something that the mainstream ought to be, well, more mindful of. Could a discipline pioneered by Buddhist monks and nuns help teach us how to get healthy, relieve stress and shed many of the neuroses that we’ve come to associate with food? Dr. Cheung is convinced that it can. Last week, she met with team members at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and asked them to spend quality time with a   almond. “The rhythm of life is becoming faster and faster, so we really don’t have the same awareness and the same ability to check into ourselves,” said Dr. Cheung, who, with the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh,   “Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life. ” “That’s why mindful eating is becoming more important. We need to be coming back to ourselves and saying: ‘Does my body need this? Why am I eating this? Is it just because I’m so sad and stressed out?’ ” The topic has even found its way into culinary circles that tend to be more focused on Rabelaisian excess than monastic restraint. In January, Dr. Michael Finkelstein, a holistic physician who oversees SunRaven, a   center in Bedford, N. Y. gave a talk about mindful gardening and eating at the   headquarters of the James Beard Foundation in New York City. “The question isn’t what are the foods to eat, in my mind,” he said in an interview. “Most people have a general sense of what the healthy foods are, but they’re not eating them. What’s on your mind when you’re eating: that’s mindful eating to me. ” A good place to try it is the Blue Cliff Monastery, in Pine Bush, N. Y. a Hudson Valley hamlet. At the serene refuge about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan, curious lay people can join Buddhist brothers and sisters for a free “day of mindfulness” twice a week. At a gathering in January, visitors watched a videotaped lecture by Thich Nhat Hanh (pronounced   ) who founded this and other monasteries around the world they strolled methodically around the grounds as part of a walking meditation, then filed into a dining room for lunch. No one spoke, in keeping with a key principle of mindful eating. The point is simply to eat, as opposed to eating and talking, eating and watching TV, or eating and watching TV and gossiping on the phone while Tweeting and updating one’s Facebook status. A long buffet table of food awaited, all of it vegan and mindfully prepared by two monks in the kitchen. There was plenty of rice, herbed chickpeas, a soup made with cubes of taro, a stew of fried tofu in tomato sauce. In silence, people piled their plates with food, added a squirt or two of condiments (eating mindfully doesn’t mean forsaking the hot sauce) and sat down together with eyes closed during a Buddhist prayer for gratitude and moderation. What followed was captivating and mysterious. Surrounded by a murmur of clinking forks, spoons and chopsticks, the Blue Cliff congregation, or sangha, spent the lunch hour contemplating the enjoyment of spice, crunch, saltiness, warmth, tenderness and   company. Some were thinking, too, about the origins of the food: the thousands of farmers, truck drivers and laborers whose work had brought it here. As their jaws moved slowly, their faces took on expressions of deep focus. Every now and then came a pause within the pause: A chime would sound, and, according to the monastery’s custom, all would stop moving and chewing in order to breathe and explore an even deeper level of sensory awareness. It looked peaceful, but inside some of those heads, a struggle was afoot. “It’s much more challenging than we would imagine,” said Carolyn Cronin, 64, who lives near the monastery and regularly attends the mindfulness days. “People are used to eating so fast. This is a practice of stopping, and we don’t realize how much we’re not stopping. ” For many people, eating fast means eating more. Mindful eating is meant to nudge us beyond what we’re craving so that we wake up to why we’re craving it and what factors might be stoking the habit of  . “As we practice this regularly, we become aware that we don’t need to eat as much,” said Phap Khoi, 43, a robed monk who has been stationed at Blue Cliff since it opened in 2007. “Whereas when people just gulp down food, they can eat a lot and not feel full. ” It’s this byproduct of mindful eating  —   its potential as a psychological barrier to overeating  —   that has generated excitement among nutritionists like Dr. Cheung. “Thich Nhat Hanh often talks about our craving being like a crying baby who is trying to draw our attention,” she said. “When the baby cries, the mother cradles the baby to try to calm the baby right away. By acknowledging and embracing our cravings through a few breaths, we can stop our autopilot of reaching out to the pint of ice cream or the bag of chips. ” The average American doesn’t have the luxury of ruminating on the intense tang of sriracha sauce at a monastery. “Most of us are not going to be Buddhist monks,” said Dr. Finkelstein, the holistic physician. “What I’ve learned is that it has to work at home. ” To that end, he and others suggest that people start with a few baby steps. “Don’t be too hard on yourself,” Dr. Cheung said. “You’re not supposed to be able to switch on your mindfulness button and be able to do it 100 percent. It’s a practice you keep working toward. ” Dr. Bays, the pediatrician, has recommendations that can sound like a return to the simple rhythms of Mayberry, if not “Little House on the Prairie. ” If it’s impossible to eat mindfully every day, consider planning one special repast a week. Click off the TV. Sit at the table with loved ones. “How about the first five minutes we eat, we just eat in silence and really enjoy our food?” she said. “It happens step by step. ” Sometimes, even she is too busy to contemplate a chickpea. So there are days when Dr. Bays will take three mindful sips of tea, “and then, O. K. I’ve got to go do my work,” she said. “Anybody can do that. Anywhere. ” Even scarfing down a burrito in the car offers an opportunity for insight. “Mindful eating includes mindless eating,” she said. “ ‘I am aware that I am eating and driving.’ ” Few places in America are as frantically abuzz with activity as the Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. but when Thich Nhat Hanh dropped by for a day of mindfulness in September, hundreds of employees showed up. Part of the event was devoted to eating thoughtfully in silence, and the practice was so well received that an hourlong wordless vegan lunch is now a monthly observance on the Google campus. “Interestingly enough, a lot of the participants are the engineers, which pleases us very much,” said Olivia Wu, an executive chef at the company. “I think it quiets the mind. I think there is a real sense of feeling restored so that they can go back to the crazy pace that they came from. ” It’s not often, after all, that those workhorse technicians get to stop and smell the pesto. “Somebody will say, ‘I ate so much less,’ ” Ms. Wu said. “And someone else will say, ‘You know, I never noticed how spicy arugula tastes.’ ” And that could be the ingredient that helps mindful eating gain traction in mainstream American culture: flavor. “So many people now have found themselves in an adversarial relationship with food, which is very tragic,” Dr. Bays said. “Eating should be a pleasurable activity. ”",0
29,The Major Potential Impact of a Corporate Tax Overhaul - The New York Times,Neil Irwin,"The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess. If there’s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that. The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money, as a percentage of the overall economy, than most of them. It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates. Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation. Among Washington’s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd, it’s known as a “  cash flow tax with border adjustment. ” It’s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago. And it could, if enacted, have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart. This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business  —   and for the   trajectory of the economy  —   are huge. The basic idea behind a D. B. C. F. T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy. Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company’s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are   the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along. The House Republicans’ approach, instead of taxing the    corporate income, goes after a firm’s domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. There’s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you’ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless. “With an income tax, one of the key issues is ‘how do you measure income,’ ” said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. “But with cash flow you just follow the money. ” And the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesn’t give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity. That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more. Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful. Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100. At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this. Many economists think it won’t work that way, however. That’s because as soon as a    tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent     effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started. Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a “textbook economic theory,” as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasn’t been tested in practice. If the dollar doesn’t strengthen as expected, for example,   industries, especially those with lean profit margins, could face disaster. That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry. Essentially, economists are telling them “trust us, our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash,” but if the models are wrong, for companies like Walmart, Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods, their viability could be threatened. If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects. Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, we don’t really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be. It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on, like clothing and gasoline. That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient. There’s still a lot of work to be done to understand the   consequences of the D. B. C. F. T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But there’s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly. No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system  —   with   economic consequences  —   will be up for grabs.",0

31,3 Makers of World’s Smallest Machines Awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry - The New York Times,Kenneth Chang and Sewell Chan,"Three pioneers in the development of nanomachines, made of moving molecules, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday. Molecular machines, the world’s smallest mechanical devices, may eventually be used to create new materials, sensors and energy storage systems, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the prize. “In terms of development, the molecular motor is at the same stage as the electric motor was in the 1830s, when scientists displayed various spinning cranks and wheels, unaware that they would lead to electric trains, washing machines, fans and food processors,” the academy said. The three scientists  —     Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa  —   will share equally in the prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $930, 000. Nanotechnology  —   the creation of structures on the scale of a nanometer, or a billionth of a meter  —   has been a field of fruitful research for a couple of decades. Now, scientists are learning how to construct tiny moving machines about   the width of a strand of human hair. “They’ve got it started,” said Donna J. Nelson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Oklahoma and president of the American Chemical Society. “This is just the beginning. ” The first step toward creating a molecular machine was making a moving part. Chemists have long been able to synthesize   molecules, and they knew that interlocking rings might function as molecular parts. But how to create a second ring that passed through the first ring? Dr. Sauvage figured that out in 1983. A charged copper ion essentially acted as a pin around which to form the interlocking rings, he found. Once the rings were connected, the copper ion could be removed. These molecules became known as catenanes. The pieces of the molecule were held together mechanically, like links in a chain, rather than the usual chemical bonds. Dr. Stoddart made the next advance in 1991. Instead of two interlocking rings, Dr. Stoddart, then at the University of Birmingham in Britain, and his colleagues synthesized a rotaxane: a ring molecule wrapped around a   axle. The ring slides back and forth along the dumbbell, like a bead on an abacus. Dr. Stoddart went on to construct a small computer chip that was essentially a molecular abacus, as well as other complex devices. One was composed of three rotaxanes whose rings were connected to form a larger platform that could rise 0. 7 billionths of a meter: a molecular elevator. Rotaxanes bending thin layers of gold acted like an artificial muscle, he found. As a sidelight, Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Stoddart used their techniques to create molecules that twisted in complicated knots. Dr. Stoddart said in an interview that he was inspired by the interlocking forms in Celtic art. Dr. Feringa, in 1999, became the first person to develop a molecular motor, creating a minuscule rotor blade powered by light that spun continually in the same direction. The first motor was not fast, but 15 years later, he and his research group demonstrated one that spun 12 million times per second. In 2011, they built a    molecular “car. ” Four of the molecular motors acted as wheels, connected by a  . The three men invigorated the field of topological chemistry, the academy said on Wednesday. They were pioneers in the second wave of nanotechnology, a field that the physicist Richard P. Feynman, also a Nobel laureate, foresaw as early as 1959. He gave a seminal lecture in 1984, toward the end of his life, on design and engineering at the molecular scale. In living organisms, nature has produced a slew of molecular machines that ferry materials around cells, construct proteins and divide cells. Artificial molecular machines are still primitive by comparison, but scientists can already envision applications in the future. “Think about nanomachines, microrobots,” said Dr. Feringa, who spoke by telephone with journalists assembled in Stockholm at the prize announcement. “Think about tiny robots that the doctor in the future will inject in your blood veins, and they go search for cancer cells or going to deliver drugs, for instance. ” The technology could also lead to the creation of “smart materials” that change properties based on external signals, Dr. Feringa said. Dr. Sauvage, 71, was born in Paris and received his Ph. D. in 1971 from the University of Strasbourg in France, where he is a professor emeritus. He is also director of research emeritus at the National Center for Scientific Research in France. Dr. Stoddart, 74, was born in Edinburgh, received his Ph. D. in 1966 from Edinburgh University, and is a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He previously taught at U. C. L. A. and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to science. Dr. Feringa, 64, was born in   the Netherlands, and received his Ph. D. in 1978 from the University of Groningen, where he is a professor of organic chemistry. Dr. Feringa said he was “a bit shocked” when he got the phone call telling him he had received the Nobel. “I feel a little bit like the Wright brothers, who were flying 100 years ago for the first time,” he said. “People were saying, ‘Why do we need a flying machine?’ And now we have a Boeing 747 and an Airbus. ” The molecular discovery “opens up a whole new world of nanomachines,” he said, while acknowledging that, as scientists figure out how to make machines that can operate autonomously, “we have to think about how we can handle these things safely. ” Dr. Stoddart’s name had been mentioned for the Nobel for years. “It really got to the point where I didn’t take it very seriously,” he said. He was asleep when the phone rang at 4 a. m. “I detected a Swedish accent, and I thought it was probably not a prank,” Dr. Stoddart said. When told that he was sharing the prize with Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Feringa, “I was totally delighted, because these are my scientific brothers in many ways,” he said. James M. Tour, a professor of chemistry at Rice University in Houston, said the Nobel would bestow legitimacy on the field and help convince people that nanomachines are not just fantastical science fiction of the far future. “No one is making money on these right now, but it will come,” he said. “These men have established and built up the field in a remarkable way. ” Dr. Tour predicted that the first profitable use of the technology might be machines that open up cell membranes in the body to deliver drugs. “It’s really going to be quite extraordinary,” he said. ■ Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for “ . ” ■ David J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for their research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states. Tomas Lindahl, Paul L. Modrich and Aziz Sancar were awarded the prize last year for discovering how cells repair their DNA and protect it from the sun’s ultraviolet light, as well as from natural toxins and industrial pollutants. Three more will be awarded in the coming days. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Norway. The Memorial Prize in Economic Science will come on Monday, Oct. 10, in Sweden.

33,"Review: ‘Lion’ Brings Tears for a Lost Boy, Wiped Dry by Google - The New York Times",A. O. Scott,"The first part of “Lion,” Garth Davis’s unabashedly   movie about a remarkable   incident, has some of the scary, wondrous feeling of a fairy tale. The audience is invited to imagine a   time  —   1986, to be precise  —   before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) who accidentally travels more than 1, 000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta. Saroo’s mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an    train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language. With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroo’s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling. What happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) who was also adopted from India and has mental health and   problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the    stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy (Rooney Mara) from America. But memories of his   life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. It’s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if you’re not familiar with the true story behind “Lion,” that the fairy tale will come true. Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin O’Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child  —   or a mother  —   this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent. Still, it isn’t quite satisfying. The transition from the young to the   Saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that “Lion” doesn’t quite achieve. What felt in the first part like wonderful, Spielbergian simplicity feels, in the latter sections, like simplification. There isn’t enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older Saroo a full identity. The movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back. At the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I can’t complain too much about that for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also can’t help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm don’   fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But we’ve lost something, too, and we can’t even see what it is. “Lion” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes.",0
34,U.S. General: Islamic State Chemical Attack Had ’No Impact’ on U.S. Forces,Kristina Wong,"WASHINGTON  —   U. S. and Australian troops advising Iraqi forces got caught up in a chemical weapons attack by the Islamic State (ISIS) in western Mosul during the weekend, a U. S. general confirmed Wednesday. [The chemical agent did not affect U. S. forces and is still undergoing testing, said Maj. Gen. Joseph Martin, the commander of U. S. and coalition ground forces in Iraq.  “Daesh has used chemicals in the vicinity of Mosul. The chemicals have had no impact on the Iraqi Security Forces. They had no impact on our forces,” Martin said, using a derogatory Arabic acronym for ISIS. A U. S. defense official said U. S. forces donned protective gear. Australian troops were not exposed to the substance, according to an article by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Australian medics provided some Iraqi forces first aid after the attack. A U. S. defense official said those Iraqi forces have returned to duty. It is not the first time ISIS has used chemical weapons in Iraq. The U. S.  military coalition confirmed in 2015 the first instances of the terrorist group using sulfur mustard and mustard gas. An assessment by IHS Conflict Monitor found in November 2015 that ISIS has used chemicals, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014. Martin said the chemicals ISIS has used in the past are all “ ” because of the group’s lack of production capability. He said the chemicals were believed to have been delivered by indirect fire, meaning via rocket or some projectile containing the chemical agent. Martin said U. S. forces have the appropriate equipment and training to protect themselves from chemical weapons. The attack also raised the question of how closely U. S. forces are operating with Iraqi forces. Officials have said U. S. troops are not on the front lines fighting ISIS. However, Martin indicated they are close together and share the same risks. Martin said U. S. forces are with Iraqi security forces at “various command and control locations throughout Iraq. ” “Being forward with those command and control facilities, they share the same risks the Iraqis do,” he said. He added that U. S. forces are “forward with the Iraqis each and every day. ” A defense official of unknown nationality told ABC that Australian and U. S. advisers were with Iraqi forces at the time of the attack. Martin characterized ISIS as getting increasingly desperate, as Iraqi forces  —   backed by the U. S.  military coalition  —   are succeeding in pushing the terrorist group out of their main stronghold in Iraq. Martin said ISIS members were turning on civilians, killing hundreds each week. “As I see it, the longer this fight goes on in west Mosul, the civilians will suffer at the hands of a brutal enemy. This is why ISIS must be defeated quickly,” he said. He said ISIS was using civilians as human shields and fighting from protected sites. “ISIS uses the tactic of taking civilians hostage for protection while they’re fighting from protected sites. ISIS has been indiscriminate in their use of [  improvised explosive devices] and building IEDs to kill, maim and injure innocent civilians as part of their ongoing campaign of terror,” he said. Martin said ISIS’s “leadership has fled and their days are numbered. ” Meanwhile, he said, Iraqi forces were getting better. “They continue to improve their capability and demonstrate a level of professionalism that makes me proud to serve with them. It’s only a matter of time before they liberate the rest of Mosul and defeat ISIS in Iraq,” he said.",0
35,"Jury finds all Oregon standoff defendants not guilty of federal conspiracy, gun charges",Admin,"Oregon Live – by Maxine Bernstein 
A federal jury on Thursday found Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five co-defendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. 
The Bundy brothers and occupiers Jeff Banta and David Fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility. Kenneth Medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property, and a hung jury was declared on Ryan Bundy’s charge of theft of FBI surveillance cameras. 
“More than we could have hoped for,” said one of Ammon Bundy’s lawyers, J. Morgan Philpot. 
“Stunning,” said defense lawyer Lisa Ludwig, who was standby counsel for Ryan Bundy. 
“I’m just thrilled,” said Neil Wampler’s attorney Lisa Maxfield. 
The jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on Thursday in the high-profile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. 
Each defendant stood separately, facing the jury, as the judge read the verdicts. Ammon Bundy, his hands clasped behind his back, nodded as the “not guilty” verdicts were read for him first. As he sat, he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer, Marcus Mumford. 
His older brother Ryan Bundy stood. As his “not guilty” verdicts were read, he nodded, and mouthed to the jury, “Thank you.” Defendant Neil Wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer, Maxfield. 
The coda to the stunning verdict, undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors, was when Ammon Bundy’s lawyer Marcus Mumford argued that his client, dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt, should be allowed to walk out of the court, a free man. 
U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown told him that there was a U.S. Marshal’s hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada. 
Oregon Standoff defendant Jeff Banta is relieved by acquittals 
“If there’s a detainer, show me,” Mumford stood, arguing before the judge. 
Suddenly, a group of about six U.S. Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table. The judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed on to him. 
“What are you doing?” Mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. 
As deputy marshals yelled, “Stop resisting,” the judge demanded, “Everybody out of the courtroom now!” 
Mumford was taken into custody, a member of his legal team confirmed. 
Ammon Bundy’s lawyer J. Morgan Philpot, said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun, or Taser, on his back. Another member of Ammon Bundy’s legal team Rick Koerber, echoed Philpot, saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him. 
Philpot decried the marshals’ treatment of Mumford in the courtroom. “What happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government,” he said. 
By 6:30 p.m., Mumford was released from custody. He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom. 
“I grew up on a dairy farm, so am I used to some rough treatment, sure?” he said. But he said the actions of the U.S. marshals were uncalled for. 
“All I was asking for was papers. Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody.” 
As to the verdict, “Very pleased, very gratified. This jury was dedicated. They listened to our case.” 
Just after the verdicts were announced, people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers. 
Supporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug. One of them, Brand Thornton of Las Vegas, one of the original occupiers who accompanied Ryan Bundy and others onto the refuge on Jan. 2 and was called as witness by the defense, said that he has been at the trial since Oct. 2. 
The verdict “means everything,” Thornton said. It’s huge for ranchers and land rights within Harney County and across the West, he said. 
“We did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful,” said Thornton, who has kept vigil outside the courthouse, blowing a shofar. 
“This is for the people of Oregon,” Thornton said. “This was never for us.” 
Wampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a “stunning victory for rural America.” 
David Fry’s lawyer Per C. Olson said, “It was the right result.” 
“I think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals,” Olson said. The jury saw that the defendants cared about the Hammonds and didn’t like how the federal government was treating them. 
Maxfield, who represented Wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. She said she has never seen “anything like this happen,” where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted, and called it one of the most significant cases in her career. 
Defendant Shawna Cox said she had a “peaceful feeling,” as she waited for the verdicts, “but I didn’t expect we’d all be found not guilty.” 
“I wept,” Cox said. “It brings me to tears. I’m so grateful to the jury.” 
Defense lawyer Matthew Schindler, standby counsel to defendant Kenneth Medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments, said he called his client right away. 
“He’s been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him,” Schindler said. “It’s vindication.” 
Schindler said he believes the jury’s verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the “intent” of the defendants was to conspire against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 
“The judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendant’s state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations,” Schindler said. 
When prosecuting a drug conspiracy, it’s easy to point to what the defendants’ underlying objective is. But in this case, Schindler said, there was “no obvious underlying self interest.” He said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state, and not just from Portland. 
Oregon U.S. Attorney Billy Williams sat in the back of the courtroom with Oregon’s FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregg Bretzing as the verdicts were read. Williams left the courtroom early, before the scrum with Mumford, to attend a gathering of the League of Minority Voters in Salem Thursday night. 
Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward, who was the face of law enforcement during the 41-day refuge takeover, said in a statement, “While I am disappointed in the outcome, I believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world. These folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers. This is our system, and I stand by it.” 
The five-week trial offered a rare display: Three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves. Five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify. 
And one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations – what the judge called an “extraordinary circumstance.” An alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors Thursday morning. 
There was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial, with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests, and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings. 
Often, supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings, and some kept vigil across the street, with one fellow occupier blowing a ram’s horn, or shofar, as the jury deliberated. 
PENDING PROSECUTIONS 
The seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge. 
Eleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. 
Seven others are set for trial on Feb. 14, but their cases may be affected by the verdicts. If convictions are handed down in this case, then defendants scheduled for trial in February might consider potential pleas. If there are acquittals, prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against co-defendants next year. 
On the eve of jury selection in this case, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against Pete Santilli, an independent broadcaster and self-described “shock jock,” who provided live stream footage of the occupation. 
NEVADA CASE 
Ammon Bundy and Ryan Bundy also face prosecution in Nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their father’s cattle near Bunkerville, Nevada. 
The trial there is set to start Feb. 6. The two brothers and father Cliven Bundy are among 19 indicted in Nevada. Others from the Oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in Nevada are Pete Santilli, Ryan Payne, Brian Cavalier, Blaine Cooper and Joseph O’Shaughnessy. 
Payne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in Oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with Nevada prosecutors, but he recently asked to withdraw the Oregon plea because no deal was reached in Nevada. Prosecutors in Portland have until Oct. 31 to respond. 
Cooper entered guilty pleas in both cases. O’Shaughnessy pleaded guilty in the Oregon case, with a deal pending in Nevada. Cavalier pleaded guilty in the Oregon case.

Here we go… 
Yes. Exactly!

This monster needs to be opened, all right. 
I’ll leave up to the readers to come up with ways to execute that idea. 
How many people were there when Nixon was reelected despite the fact that the Watergate investigation was in full swing? That ended pretty badly for Tricky Dick. And Killer was on the judicial investigation group at this time. This group was lead by a Democrat and he fired Killer for lying. I don’t recall the nature of the lie but it was enough to get her fired. 
From Fox News Politics 

FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress Friday that the bureau has “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” 
Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced “in connection with an unrelated case.” 
He told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, “and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete “this additional work.”",1
37,Pence Will Speak at Anti-Abortion Rally - The New York Times,Jeremy W. Peters,"WASHINGTON  —   Vice President Mike Pence will speak on Friday to a gathering of   activists on the National Mall, a sign of the movement’s new and growing authority in a government now dominated by Republicans. The organizers for the event, the March for Life, had extended invitations to President Trump and Mr. Pence. A senior White House official confirmed that Mr. Pence would address the marchers. Mr. Pence’s appearance will come just a few days before Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice  Antonin Scalia  last year. Mr. Trump has said his pick, like Mr. Scalia, would oppose abortion rights, one of several promises he has made to roll back legal protections for the procedure. Other Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, have spoken to the march, but remotely.   leaders see the Trump administration’s commitment to their cause and the looming Supreme Court nomination battle as a tipping point after eight years of a Democratic administration. The symbolism of hearing from Mr. Pence and another senior Trump administration official, Kellyanne Conway, at the march is hard to overlook. Mr. Trump eventually won over many reluctant   leaders who had chafed at his past support for abortion rights and his history of being a    role model for religious conservatives. Mr. Trump’s pledges to them, which he made in writing before the election, have gone a long way to rebuilding trust.   activists say they are among the most detailed and serious pledges a president has made to their cause. They include a vow to sign a nationwide ban on abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and a commitment to ensuring that his Supreme Court appointments are against the procedure.",0

— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 27, 2016 
Sen. Sanders was correct. Elections are supposed to be contests about ideas and visions for the future. However, the Republican Party ran out of ideas decades ago and has been on a slow and steady descent into substituting beliefs for facts, and hopes for visions. 
Trump is trying to suppress the vote because voter suppression is the only tactic that he has left that may lead him to victory. 
It takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles. Donald Trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the Oval Office. 
The media will never say it, but real candidates for office don’t try to win by discouraging people from voting. The best candidates get people excited to vote and play their vital role in the democratic process. 
Bernie Sanders gets it. Donald Trump never will.",1
39,How To Make Briquettes From Daily Waste,Chris Black,"  22, 2016 How To Make Briquettes From Daily Waste 
Do you remember that old saying that one man’s garbage is another man’s treasure? The same principle applies to our daily wastes. 
In case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and that’s nothing to be proud of. 
We waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. 
If you crunch these numbers– 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste – you’ll come up with astonishing numbers. 
Putting Waste to Work for Energy 
It was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted – everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guy’s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . 
We, the preppers, can help mitigate the “disaster” and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. 
Briquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material – usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust – that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means “brick.” 
Biomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and they’re used as a “green” replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. 
Currently, almost half of the world’s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. 
Cutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and that’s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? 
Any household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making “fuel briquettes” using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. 
How to Make the Briquettes 
So, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. 
It’s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. 
As a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but you’ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. 
There are also commercially available presses. You’ll just have to look for them on the internet or in   
The fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . 
You can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . 
Basically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. You’ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. 
Here’s a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. 
Video first seen on nobodyprepper . 
How to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps 
Step 1 – preparing the briquette mix 
For example, if you’re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), you’ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. 
In the next step, you’ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the “soup”. This step is very important but it takes some time and you’ll have to do it well. 
To speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. 
The simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as they’ll add to the flavor. You’ll have to use roughly 20% paper though – that’s the lesson to be taken home. 
You can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paper’s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. You’ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. 
In the next step, you’ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; that’s how you determine the ideal consistency. 
Step 2 – prepare the press 
This step depends on whether you’re using a cool home press or an improvised device. Let’s say you’re on the low-tech side and you’re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. 
You’ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. 
Then you’ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Don’t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. 
Obviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally you’ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Don’t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though – otherwise, the water won’t drain and you’re wasting your time. 
Step 3 – press the mix 
In this step, you’ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then you’ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. 
Push as hard as you can – the harder the better. Then you’ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and here’s your first briquette, folks. 
Step 4 – dry your briquettes 
But it’s not over yet. You’ll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun. If they’re not properly dried, the briquettes will smoke when burned and that’s unpleasant to say the least. 
If you can’t improvise a mold and/or a press, you can always make fuel-briquettes with just your hands, squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and you’ll have to dry these out too, obviously. 
There are so many survival things you can do by yourself.   discover   wood creations.

41,Dress Like a Woman? What Does That Mean? - The New York Times,Jacey Fortin,"What does it mean to “dress like a woman”? Social media users took it upon themselves to answer that very question in response to a report that President Trump wants women who work for him to look a certain way. The sentiment was anonymously cited in the new newsletter Axios from Mike Allen, a former Politico reporter. In response, Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead, as firefighters, soldiers, police officers and astronauts, to name a few. But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category, the “dress like a woman” phrase,   as a hashtag, didn’t come directly from Mr. Trump. In his newsletter, Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way: In an email on Friday afternoon, Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details. It’s clear that appearances matter to the president. Mr. Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has come under harsh criticism for rating women’s appearances on a scale of one to 10 and for hurling insults at female critics. As a candidate, he readily attacked when people commented on the size of his hands or on his hair. Like presidents past, Mr. Trump will most likely have some influence over style in the West Wing. The White House does not have an official dress code, according to its Press Office, but every administration has its own norms. For the past two decades, wardrobes have tended to be more relaxed in Democratic administrations. Under President Clinton, “aides frequently attended meetings in jeans and ” The New York Times reported in 2001. President George W. Bush restored formality to the West Wing, but President Obama was so relaxed that he broke with protocol, foregoing a suit jacket on his first full day in the Oval Office. If the pattern holds, dressing for work in the West Wing could become more formal under the Trump administration. Whether that means women would be required to “dress like women” remains to be seen.",0
42,"At 91, Ella Brennan Still Feeds (and Leads) New Orleans - The New York Times",Brett Anderson,"NEW ORLEANS  —   A typical evening for Ella Brennan begins with cocktails. They are delivered from Commander’s Palace, her family’s restaurant next door to her mansion in this city’s historic Garden District. Drinks are often followed by dinner, also from Commander’s, and wine. Ms. Brennan favors Champagne and distinguished whites from the Côte de Beaune because, as she puts it, “I’m too damn old to drink cheap wine” and “because I can. ” In New Orleans, there is little question that Miss Ella, as Ms. Brennan is widely known here, has earned her sense of entitlement. Her hometown’s civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence Ms. Brennan helped create that reputation, and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years. At 91, she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1, 400 people, both full and part time, and she has mentored countless talents, including the celebrity chefs Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse. “She was there to embrace and elevate, not just me but the entire staff,” said Mr. Lagasse, whom Ms. Brennan plucked from obscurity and installed, at age 23, as Commander’s chef in the early 1980s. “The list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in America is endless. ” Ms. Brennan’s family has recently set out to ensure that her legacy is appreciated beyond New Orleans. Those efforts culminated last year with the release of a memoir, “Miss Ella of Commander’s Palace,” written with Ti Martin, her daughter. It was followed by the documentary “Ella Brennan: Commanding the Table,” directed by Leslie Iwerks. The film, which has been screening at festivals, will be available on Netflix in May. The book and film tell the story of a     businesswoman  —   her other nickname is Hurricane Ella  —   who excelled in a   profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue. “When I first started, you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen, much less running the show,” said Sue Zemanick, the former chef at Gautreau’s, a “Top Chef Masters” contestant and a line cook at Commander’s early in her career. “Working at a restaurant with such strong women in charge gave me hope that I could make it. ” While Ms. Brennan is, as Ms. Martin put it, “as retired as Mom is capable of being,” her New Orleans restaurants, which include Café Adelaide and SoBou, remain an obsession for her they are managed by Ms. Martin and Lally Brennan, a niece of Ms. Brennan. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room. As she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor, she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman. “In those days, no one was paying attention to developing people,” she said. “A restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of. ” Her decision to tap Mr. Prudhomme, a Cajun, to run Commander’s kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that   chefs had on American fine dining. Alongside Ms. Brennan, and later on his own, the   Mr. Prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in American regional cooking that has yet to abate. “New Orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole American food movement,” the New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent said. “And Ella put New Orleans on the map. ” Ms. Brennan entered the hospitality business as a teenager working at the Old Absinthe House, a Bourbon Street bar owned by her brother Owen, 15 years her senior. She had dropped out of a local business school after deciding, as she wrote in her book, that “I wasn’t going to type for any man. ” In 1946, Mr. Brennan bought Vieux Carré, a French Quarter restaurant that Ms. Brennan described recently, with typical candor, as “terrible. ” Mr. Brennan hired her to manage the business, looking to prove that an Irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established   restaurants like Arnaud’s, Antoine’s and Galatoire’s. “I didn’t know anything,” Ms. Brennan recalled. “But Owen was a raconteur. He slept till noon. He got me to do all of the things he didn’t like. So I learned. ” A voracious reader, she pored over books recommended by the restaurant’s two chefs, Jack Eames and Paul Blangé, whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised. “I was amazed at their talent,” she said. “They were like surgeons. ” The gregarious Brennan family  —   the other siblings were Dick, Adelaide, Dottie and John  —   cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors, including celebrities. All the while, Ms. Brennan worked with the chefs to elevate Vieux Carré’s food. For inspiration, she traveled frequently to New York City, where she became a regular at the “21” Club. Culinary pioneers like James Beard and Helen McCully, the food editor of McCall’s magazine, took the young visitor under their wings. “You had to go to New York in those days,” Ms. Brennan said. “I was trying to get New Orleans to that level. ” In 1955, the Brennans were preparing to relocate Vieux Carré to a larger space on Royal Street when Owen died of a heart attack at 45. It fell to Ms. Brennan to carry out her brother’s vision for the new restaurant, which would be called Brennan’s. By all accounts, Brennan’s ushered in a new age for fine dining in the South. It became a grand showcase for New Orleans joie de vivre, replete with a wine cellar, antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional   cuisine. The national press took notice, especially of its boozy, multicourse breakfasts. “America was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment,” Ms. Brennan wrote, “and all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food. ” Ms. Brennan helped develop new dishes, including bananas Foster. She pushed to expand the family’s restaurant properties, with spotty success, aggravating a rift between Owen’s heirs and what came to be known as “Ella’s side” of the family. In 1973, Ms. Brennan was dismissed from Brennan’s, initiating a bitter, litigious family split that has never fully healed. “It was a tragedy,” Ms. Brennan said. “Family is everything to us. ” (Owen Brennan’s sons continued to run Brennan’s until 2013, when a group that includes Ralph Brennan, a son of John Brennan, purchased the   property at a sheriff’s auction. Brennan’s of Houston, overseen by Ms. Brennan’s son Alex, is part of her restaurant group.) Commander’s Palace, which Ms. Brennan acquired in 1969, was a sprawling property in need of repair. In partnership with her sisters and brothers, she set about turning it into a restaurant that would eclipse Brennan’s. Early reviews weren’t favorable. But over time, Commander’s became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south Louisiana and nouvelle cuisines  —   Ms. Brennan christened the style haute Creole  —   and its warm, celebratory approach to fine dining. “We want people who eat here to feel important, and we want them to have fun,” Ms. Brennan said. Ms. Brennan never presumed that her management responsibilities ended at the kitchen door. Alex McCrery, a Commander’s line cook in the early 2000s, recalled that Ms. Brennan admonished another cook for proposing that the kitchen make mustard ice cream. “She was the type who was like your mom is when she is disappointed in you,” Mr. McCrery said. “She was stern, and you’d feel like you really messed up. ” Ms. Brennan said she “gave up men for Lent” after her divorce in 1970 from Paul Martin. She also never learned to cook (“I don’t think she can boil water,” Mr. Lagasse said) but that doesn’t prevent her from giving lavish dinner parties in the home she shares with Dottie. “We don’t carry on like we once did,” she said before a recent meal. “But I do like to take advantage of living next door to my restaurant. ” A waiter carried Ms. Brennan’s drink as she moved, with the aid of a walker, from her   parlor to her   dining room. She sat at the head of the table as Commander’s waiters delivered a series of courses from the restaurant’s kitchen. As she sank her spoon into a steaming sea urchin and stone crab soufflé, Ms. Brennan explained that entertaining gives her an opportunity to weigh in on new ideas from Tory McPhail, Commander’s current and   chef. It also allows her to partake in the kind of pleasure she has provided others for so long. “What we’re doing here tonight is letting him experiment on us,” she said, referring to Mr. McPhail, who had just introduced a course of lamb osso buco. Ms. Brennan was as engaged and vivacious as when the evening began. As Mr. McPhail turned to leave, she called after him, “Bring back a bottle of Champagne, will you?” Recipe: Bananas Foster",0
43,"Pressing Asia Agenda, Obama Treads Lightly on Human Rights - The New York Times",Jane Perlez,"HANGZHOU, China  —   Human rights barely registered on President Obama’s latest visit to China, which ended Monday night with a news conference at which he made only a glancing reference to differences with Beijing over “religious freedom. ” And as Mr. Obama moved on to Laos for a summit meeting of Asian nations, human rights advocates worried that their concerns were falling off the American agenda not only with China but also across the region, for the same reason: Beijing’s continuing rise as an economic and geopolitical power. As China challenges the United States for influence in Asia, the administration is concerned that any criticism of nations like Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Laos for backsliding on human rights could alienate them rather than pulling them closer. At the same time, shining a spotlight on China’s own rough treatment of dissidents risks losing Beijing’s cooperation on issues like trade, climate change and nuclear proliferation. Rights advocates accused the administration of being too timid, arguing that the United States should put as much pressure on governments over how they treat their citizens as they do during trade negotiations. “Decades of experience should make clear to Washington that Beijing responds only to the expectation of unpleasant consequences,” said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch. “Why not threaten sanctions, cut out the pointless pomp or visibly align with peaceful critics of the government?” she said. “On other diplomatic, economic and security issues, governments recognize and use these points of leverage. Why not on human rights?” Others say Mr. Obama, who speaks openly about civil rights in the United States, has been wise not to inject the issue into talks with China, even as Beijing has carried out the most sweeping crackdown on Chinese civil society in nearly 20 years. They say the president understands that a more powerful China is better able to resist American pressure on human rights than it was a decade ago. “To its credit, the Obama administration has not exacerbated the many U. S.  economic and security issues with a   human rights policy,” said Robert S. Ross, a professor of political science at Boston College. “It is quite a stretch to argue that diplomacy could persuade an authoritarian,   government to undermine its domestic political power by allowing greater opposition to the government and tolerating greater political instability. ” The pattern is now extending beyond China’s borders. During Mr. Obama’s visit to Laos, a tiny country run by a repressive Communist regime, he so far has chosen not to publicly raise the case of an   civil rights worker who disappeared at a police checkpoint four years ago. He has refrained, at least in public, from criticizing the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has been unapologetic about waging a violent war against drugs in the first two months of his term. On Wednesday, a day after Mr. Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with Mr. Duterte, who had unleashed a   diatribe against him, the two men met informally. During Mr. Obama’s visit to Vietnam in May, he agreed to lift a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal weapons without winning significant concessions on human rights. And after trying to draw Malaysia closer, Mr. Obama has been embarrassed by the country’s prime minister, Najib Razak, who has closed online news outlets and prosecuted opposition figures in an effort to stay in power. The Obama administration has pressed China on human rights in a   way on only a few occasions. In 2012, the American Embassy in Beijing harbored Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese dissident, and flew him to the United States. But the days when the White House could demand and expect the release of a few Chinese political prisoners before a summit meeting are gone, Professor Ross said. As the Chinese Communist Party gained confidence, it began rearresting dissidents who had been released before American summit meetings. “Since then,” Professor Ross said, “U. S. human rights diplomacy has been reduced to rhetoric, which, no surprise, has not improved China’s human rights situation. ” Despite Mr. Obama’s fleeting public reference to religious repression this week, for example, few expect the Chinese authorities to retreat from a campaign against Christian churches in the area surrounding Hangzhou, the city that hosted the Group of 20 meeting. One of the new challenges for Mr. Obama, and one for his successor, will be how to deal with Mr. Duterte. The police in the Philippines say they have killed about 1, 000 suspects in the antidrug campaign, and about 300 people have been killed by vigilantes. Rights groups have urged the United States to do something about the situation. “It’d be difficult for us to overstate how grave the situation has become in the Philippines,” said John Sifton, the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch. “At this rate, we’re talking about over 6, 000 people dead by the end of the year. ” But the Philippines is an American ally and a bulwark against Chinese military gains in the South China Sea. By that calculus, the United States cannot afford to alienate Mr. Duterte. Philippine analysts say that Mr. Duterte is on good terms with Chinese business executives who invested in Davao, the city where he served as mayor, and that he may be open to negotiating with Beijing over the South China Sea. Under American legislation known as the Leahy Amendment, Washington is obliged to cut off assistance to Philippines law enforcement units that are suspected of human rights abuses. But Antonio La Viña, a professor of government at Ateneo de Manila University, said the threat of such a sanction was unlikely to be effective. “The truth is that the Philippines has the money to modernize our military,” he said. Mr. Obama is the first sitting American president to visit Laos, and he has sought to promote reconciliation with the nation, on which the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs at the height of the Vietnam War. But he is also being called on to press Laos’s repressive government  —   a traditional ally of China  —   on the case of Sombath Somphone, a civil rights campaigner and   agriculture specialist who disappeared at a police checkpoint in the capital, Vientiane, four years ago. Mr. Obama will also have to decide how hard to push concerns about human rights with other leaders at the meeting, several of whom are being wooed by China. One of Mr. Obama’s favorite Southeast Asian leaders, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, is scheduled to visit the White House this month, and American officials hope to make progress on addressing the plight of the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority in the predominantly Buddhist country. More than 100, 000 Rohingya live in   camps in northern Myanmar, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has appointed a commission that includes the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan to find solutions. “She has demonstrated a recognition that this is a problem that must be solved,” said Tom Malinowski, the United States assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor. The Obama administration has been less vocal on conditions in Vietnam, which it has tried to steer closer to the United States in the face of Chinese pressure over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Since then, the human rights situation has only deteriorated, said Nguyen Quang A, an activist and a former member of the Vietnamese Communist Party who was invited to meet Mr. Obama in Hanoi but who was stopped by Vietnamese security forces. Political prisoners remain in jail, the news media is muzzled, and independent labor unions have not been allowed, despite promises to Washington. “Should Obama have done more to try and influence the government of Vietnam?” Mr. Quang A asked. “Absolutely. ”",0
44,Democrats Have a 60 Percent Chance to Retake the Senate - The New York Times,Josh Katz,"The Upshot’s new Senate election forecast gives Democrats a 60 percent chance of winning control of the chamber in November. Included within this 60 percent is a 17 percent chance that the Senate ends up evenly split with a Democratic vice president providing the tiebreaking vote. By our count, the Democrats need to win five seats among the 11 most competitive races. (The Democrats will need to win six if Donald J. Trump wins the presidential race we put Mr. Trump’s chances of winning at only  11 percent). Ten of these seats are held by Republicans, and one by a Democrat, Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring. That the Democrats are favored in this election should not be surprising. The 2016 Senate elections boded well for the Democrats without any consideration of a possible Trump effect on   races. In recent history, Democrats have done better in presidential election years than in midterm years, when turnout is lower. Most of the senators up for   last went before the voters in the Republican wave election of 2010  —   when the G. O. P. made big and broad gains in an   environment  —   leaving Republicans with several potentially vulnerable incumbents. This year, the Democrats are defending only 10 seats while the Republicans have to preserve 24. On fundamentals alone  —   that is, historical voting patterns, the candidates’ political experience and    —   the Democrats would have about a   shot to win the Senate. The latest Senate polling improves this figure to 60 percent. The framework for our model is broadly similar to the approach we took in 2014, when our Election Day forecast correctly called 35 of 36 Senate races. That approach means starting with the fundamentals as a prior, then updating those beliefs as polling information comes in. We let races affect one another and assume that the    errors will be correlated. The main difference between 2014 and this year is that we have some additional information to gauge candidates’ chances in a presidential year. Previous research suggests that there is a strong relationship between presidential and Senate voting. Accordingly, our model assumes that Senate races will track the presidential race in each state to some degree. That is, if Hillary Clinton has improved her standing in the presidential forecast since the last time a state has been polled, we “ ” the Senate polling average a small amount in the same direction. Incumbents are running in seven of the 10 seats being defended by Democrats. All seven seats are considered safe. For the other three: ■ Democrats are guaranteed to win the seat in California: Barbara Boxer is retiring, and two Democrats  —   Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez  —   won the top two spots in an open primary. ■ Initial polling in Maryland showed the Democratic candidate, Chris Van Hollen, up by 20 to 30 points. ■ It’s only in Nevada, where Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to replace Mr. Reid, where the election is competitive. This leaves Democrats with 36 seats that are not up for election this year  —   including two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who both caucus with Democrats  —   in addition to nine safe seats. Much of the weakness in the Republican position comes from seven G. O. P. incumbents in mostly   states trying to win a second term after first being elected in the Republican wave year of 2010: Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Mark Kirk in Illinois, Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Roy Blunt in Missouri, Rob Portman in Ohio, and Marco Rubio in Florida (assuming he wins the Republican primary next week). In addition, the retirement of the Republican Dan Coats along with the entry of the former Democratic senator Evan Bayh in the race in Indiana shifted that seat from a likely Republican hold to a possible Democratic pickup. Richard Burr’s seat in North Carolina also seems vulnerable. Polling indicates that even Senator John McCain of Arizona could be swept out by the encroaching Democratic tide. If Mr. McCain beats back a primary challenge from the Tea Party candidate Kelli Ward, he will face a Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick, who was within two points in a June poll. Our model gives Ms. Kirkpatrick a roughly    chance of taking the seat. To give themselves a cushion in retaking the Senate, Democrats would probably need to win six of these 11 races: the seven elections with   Republicans the elections in Indiana, Arizona and North Carolina and the contest for Mr. Reid’s seat in Nevada. If Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency and they win five seats, they will most likely control that chamber because the vice president has the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. With so many seats remaining uncertain, the race could still tip in either direction, with Republicans possibly retaining a slim majority or Democrats running the table. As of today, the most likely outcome is a tie.",0
45,"News: PR Disaster: The President Of Panasonic Has Been Forced To Resign After 60,000 Panasonic TVs Ascended To Heaven Without Warning",nan,"Email 
Get ready for the most cringeworthy story you’re going to read all day. 
Panasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, but after today, they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat. The company’s president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 Panasonic TVs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. 
We’ll give you a minute to finish shaking your head. 
The scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the company’s popular DX802-model flat-screen TVs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to Earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. 
Yikes. Needless to say, Panasonic customers are not happy! Only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of God, Panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this: 
Wow. Panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one! Chances are, when you’re trying to stay competitive as one of the world’s foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. 
We’ve got to give credit where credit is due: At least Panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. The company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, Kazuhiro Tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tsuga issued the following statement: 
“After much consideration, I have chosen to step down as the president of Panasonic Corp. If I could, I would travel to Heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. I would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these TVs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal Panasonic customers on Earth. Even if I saw God sitting on one of our missing DX802 flat-screens, I would shove the Lord off of the TV so that I could retrieve it for our customers. Unfortunately, I do not have the power to travel to Heaven, and so I am left with no choice but to resign my position.” 
Tsuga’s resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesn’t bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. Panasonic’s reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions. Whoever steps up to become Panasonic’s new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again.",1
46,Judge spanks transgender-obsessed Obama: You lie! | RedFlag News,Redflag Newsdesk,"
Bob Unruh | WND 
For a third time, a federal judge has affirmed a nationwide injunction against the Obama administration’s agenda to impose mandatory open-restroom policies on schools from coast to coast, scolding the White House for repeating old arguments and catching those who submitted the newest arguments in a lie. 
The ruling this week from U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor left intact his nationwide injunction against Obama’s decision that transgender public school students can use the restroom of their choice, rather than the restroom designated for their physical sex. 
The White House issued the order some months ago, and when several states sued, O’Connor found in August that they were likely to prevail in their arguments, so he suspended implementation of the program nationwide. 
In October, when he had to address the issue again because of demands from the White House, he doubled down, stating, “It is clear from Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent that this court has the power to issue a nationwide injunction where appropriate. Both Title IX and Title VII rely on the consistent, uniform application of national standards in education and workplace policy. 
“A nationwide injunction is necessary because the alleged violation extends nationwide. Defendants are a group of agencies and administrators capable of enforcing their guidelines nationwide, affecting numerous state and school district facilities across the country.” 
Now in another ruling prompted by demands from the Obama administration, O’Connor has affirmed the decision – again. ",1
47,51 U.S. Diplomats Urge Strikes Against Assad in Syria - The New York Times,Mark Landler,"WASHINGTON  —   More than 50 State Department diplomats have signed an internal memo sharply critical of the Obama administration’s policy in Syria, urging the United States to carry out military strikes against the government of President Bashar   to stop its persistent violations of a   in the country’s    civil war. The memo, a draft of which was provided to The New York Times by a State Department official, says American policy has been “overwhelmed” by the unrelenting violence in Syria. It calls for “a judicious use of   and air weapons, which would undergird and drive a more focused and   U. S.  diplomatic process. ” Such a step would represent a radical shift in the administration’s approach to the civil war in Syria, and there is little evidence that President Obama has plans to change course. Mr. Obama has emphasized the military campaign against the Islamic State over efforts to dislodge Mr. Assad. Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, have all but collapsed. But the memo, filed in the State Department’s “dissent channel,” underscores the deep rifts and lingering frustration within the administration over how to deal with a war that has killed more than 400, 000 people. The State Department set up the channel during the Vietnam War as a way for employees who had disagreements with policies to register their protest with the secretary of state and other top officials, without fear of reprisal. While dissent cables are not that unusual, the number of signatures on this document, 51, is extremely large, if not unprecedented. The names on the memo are almost all midlevel officials  —   many of them career diplomats  —   who have been involved in the administration’s Syria policy over the last five years, at home or abroad. They range from a Syria desk officer in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to a former deputy to the American ambassador in Damascus. While there are no widely recognized names,   State Department officials are known to share their concerns. Mr. Kerry himself has pushed for stronger American action against Syria, in part to force a diplomatic solution on Mr. Assad. The president has resisted such pressure, and has been backed up by his military commanders, who have raised questions about what would happen in the event that Mr. Assad was forced from power  —   a scenario that the draft memo does not address. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, declined to comment on the memo, which top officials had just received. But he said Mr. Kerry respected the process as a way for employees “to express policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership. ” Robert S. Ford, a former ambassador to Syria, said, “Many people working on Syria for the State Department have long urged a tougher policy with the Assad government as a means of facilitating arrival at a negotiated political deal to set up a new Syrian government. ” Mr. Ford, who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, resigned from the Foreign Service in 2014 out of frustration with the administration’s   policy toward the conflict. In the memo, the State Department officials wrote that the Assad government’s continuing violations of the partial   known as a cessation of hostilities, will doom efforts to broker a political settlement because Mr. Assad will feel no pressure to negotiate with the moderate opposition or other factions fighting him. The government’s barrel bombing of civilians, it said, is the “root cause of the instability that continues to grip Syria and the broader region. ” “The moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria, after five years of brutal war, is evident and unquestionable,” it said. “The status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire, if not disastrous, humanitarian, diplomatic and   challenges. ” The memo acknowledged that military action would have risks, not the least further tensions with Russia, which has intervened in the war on Mr. Assad’s behalf and helped negotiate a  . Those tensions increased on Thursday when, according to a senior Pentagon official, Russia conducted airstrikes in southern Syria against   forces fighting the Islamic State. The State Department officials insisted in their memo that they were not “advocating for a slippery slope that ends in a military confrontation with Russia,” but rather a credible threat of military action to keep Mr. Assad in line. Once that threat was in place, the memo said, Mr. Kerry could undertake a diplomatic mission similar to the one he led with Iran on its nuclear program. The expression of dissent came a week after Mr. Assad showed renewed defiance of the United States and other countries, vowing to retake “every inch” of his country from his enemies. The   which Mr. Kerry helped negotiate in Munich last winter, has never really taken hold. Mr. Assad has continued to block humanitarian convoys, despite a warning that the United Nations would begin airdrops of food to starving towns. “There is an enormous frustration in the bureaucracy about Syria policy,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy. “What’s brought this to a head now is the real downturn in the negotiations, not just between the U. S. and Russia, but between Assad and the opposition. ” Last month, Mr. Kerry rejected the suggestion that the United States and its allies would never use force to stop the bombings or enforce humanitarian access. “If President Assad has come to a conclusion there’s no Plan B,” he said, “then he’s come to a conclusion that is totally without any foundation whatsoever and even dangerous. ” Still, Mr. Obama has shown little sign of shifting his focus from the campaign against the Islamic State  —   a strategy that probably acquired even more urgency after the mass shooting Sunday in Orlando, Fla. In the memo, the State Department officials argued that military action against Mr. Assad would help the fight against the Islamic State because it would bolster moderate Sunnis, who are necessary allies against the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. While the State Department has a tradition of being open to dissent  —   in the 1990s, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Foreign Service officers who had written a   dissent on the Clinton administration’s Balkans policy  —   Mr. Christopher and his successors have been frustrated when these classified memos become public. In this case, the memo mainly confirms what has been clear for some time: The State Department’s rank and file have chafed at the White House’s refusal to be drawn into the conflict in Syria. During a debate in June 2013, after the Assad government had used chemical weapons against its own people, Mr. Kerry brandished a State Department report that argued that the United States needed to respond militarily or Mr. Assad would view it as “green light for continued CW use. ” Three years later, the sense of urgency at the State Department has not diminished. The memo concludes, “It is time that the United States, guided by our strategic interests and moral convictions, lead a global effort to put an end to this conflict once and for all. ”",0

49,"Louisiana, Simone Biles, U.S. Presidential Race: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Andrea Kannapell and Sandra Stevenson,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Floodwaters saturated southern Louisiana, forcing more desperate rescues and evacuations. The death toll rose to 11, and tens of thousands of people have been displaced. Some areas have received as much as 31 inches of rain (yes, 31) in the last week  —   a     phenomenon that some experts say foretells the disasters of climate change. _____ 2. At the Olympics, the spectacular American gymnast Simone Biles scooped up her fourth gold medal, soaring past the competition in the floor exercise. More of today’s highlights are here. Fans of the U. S. runner Allyson Felix raged over a dive across the finish line by the Bahamian Shaunae Miller to win the women’s 400 meters. And an Irish boxer, Michael Conlon, raged against judges after they ruled he lost to a Russian, Vladimir Nikitin, in a bout many observers believed he had won. Our full coverage of the Games is here, including the   battle for the 2024 Olympics and a meditation on the sometimes mystifying theatrics in synchronized swimming. _____ 3. Donald Trump spoke at a rally in a suburb of Milwaukee, steering clear of the area where unrest flared after a fatal police shooting. He accused Hillary Clinton of pushing an   “narrative” and said, “Law and order must be restored. ” His campaign focus has shifted to the theme of fighting terrorism, with a special focus on protecting women. He’s also portraying Hillary Clinton as weak and tired. _____ 4. Four sources told our political reporters that Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman ousted last month over accusations of sexual harassment, is advising Donald Trump as he prepares for the coming presidential debates. A Trump spokeswoman issued a denial, saying the two are friends and “speak occasionally, which isn’t news. ” _____ 5. Hillary Clinton traveled to Philadelphia for a   drive, bolstered by new polls showing her lead strengthening in Florida. Her campaign is spending heavily to influence early voting, which is allowed in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The first, Minnesota, begins on Sept. 23. Almost   of voters cast early ballots in 2012. The F. B. I. under pressure from House Republicans, gave Congress classified documents related to its investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. _____ 6. Russia launched air attacks in Syria from an air base in Iran, becoming the first foreign military to operate from Iranian territory since at least World War II. The move could alter the political and military equation in the Middle East.

52,Colin Kaepernick Starts Black Panther-Inspired Youth Camp? Wow!,Scott Osborn,"0 comments Colin Kaepernick has started a kids camp inspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan and said he didn’t want the media to find out. 
Well I wonder why he would not want the media to find out he was taking such a far out approach with children? 
MAYBE his goal is to make little Black Panthers out of our youth? The NY DAILY NEWS reports: 
Please don’t say anything about it online,” Colin asked me a few days before the camp. “I’m not doing this for the press and I don’t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.” 
nspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan, on their 50th Anniversary, the camp created 10 rights that each child has the right to know. They were listed on the back of T-shirts given to each camper. 
“We’re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. We’re here to give you tools to help you succeed,” he said. “We’re going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in America were based on, and we’re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.” 
Why couldn’t Kaepernick just be normal and do something good for kids? Why so secretive? Why push such an extreme political agenda from an extremist group? 
Kaepernick could have taken another road. He has instead taken an anti-American, anti-Law Enforcement road. He has chosen the road of hate and divisiveness instead of the road of Patriotism and unity. 
Kaepernick wants to pass this line of reasoning on to children. insanity on many levels.",1
53,Trump’s Immigration Policies Explained - The New York Times,"Nicholas Kulish, Vivian Yee, Caitlin Dickerson, Liz Robbins, Fernanda Santos and Jennifer Medina","With an executive order last month and a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos on Tuesday, the Trump administration has significantly hardened the country’s policies regarding illegal immigration. Here are some of the most significant elements of the new approach: In 2014, the Obama administration issued guidelines for deporting unauthorized immigrants that placed the highest priority on gang members, felons and those who posed security threats. A goal was to concentrate limited resources on the most serious cases, but many Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents complained that the priorities tied their hands, taking away their discretion as to whom to pursue. Under the new directives, the government “no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. ” Immigration agents can now focus on picking up and removing anyone charged with or convicted of any criminal offense, even minor ones, as well as anyone already ordered deported, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. One unauthorized immigrant in California, Kristina, who did not want her last name used because of fear of deportation, said she was alarmed to learn on Tuesday that she would now be considered a prime target. Kristina has been in the country for 25 years and has been ordered deported, but her removal had been postponed for the last four years by the Obama administration. “We have our whole lives here our children are citizens,” she said. “Now I don’t know if I can go out, if I should drive. ” But the Obama guidelines “translated into de facto protections” for people with no legal right to live in the United States, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants. Unless they fell into one of the   categories, Mr. Stein said, “the chance of being deported was virtually zero. ” Under the Obama administration, people caught crossing the border without permission were often released into the United States while their requests for asylum wound through the immigration system, a process that can take years. Most requests are denied, but by then, the immigrant has been living in the United States all that time and may not be easy to find. The Trump administration has declared an end to the   catch and release policy, though it may take awhile to see any significant change. “Catch and release” came about in part because the government had nowhere to hold detainees waiting for immigration decisions. One of the memos released on Tuesday directs officials to expand detention facilities, but it will take time to build centers big enough, or find enough room in jails, to hold the thousands of Mexican and Central American asylum seekers expected to cross the border this year. The document also raises another alternative: sending migrants back to Mexico to wait out the immigration process, even those who are not originally from Mexico. That proposal comes with its own problems. Though United States law appears to allow it, Mexico’s laws do not, if the immigrant is not a Mexican citizen. Two decades ago, Congress passed a law allowing the government to quickly deport undocumented immigrants who have not been in the United States very long, without allowing them go before a judge. In practice, the government has used this process, called “expedited removal,” relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Since 2002, expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. That is because the Supreme Court has held that such immigrants can still be considered “in transit” and not here long enough to qualify for due process protections. The Trump administration is now planning to use expedited removal as extensively as the original law allows, saying that limits on its use had contributed to a backlog of more than half a million cases in immigration court. Immigration advocates vowed to challenge the change. “Someone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A. C. L. U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. “He is going to be detained and removed right away without ever seeing a judge. ” One of the memos on Tuesday acknowledges that children who arrive at the border alone  —   “unaccompanied alien children,” in government parlance  —   are entitled to special protections: Unlike other border crossers, whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing, these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer. Children have surged across the border in recent years, many fleeing violence and destitution in Central America. But the memo turns a sterner face to their parents, who, under the new policy, may be subject to deportation or even prosecution for enabling their children to come into the country. The memo notes that parents and relatives often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children from Central America, an act that the memo says amounts to facilitating illegal smuggling or trafficking. Immigration advocates are predicting that the policy will drive parents of migrant children further underground. With parents fearful of prosecution, advocates say, navigating the immigration process  —   or even showing up to court  —   could become much harder for these children. Some 750, 000 people who were brought into the country as children were issued work permits and temporary protection from deportation under an Obama program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Even President Trump said last week that the subject “is very, very difficult” for him and that he promised to “deal with DACA with heart. ” So far, the Trump administration has left the program alone. But chills went through the community of “Dreamers,” as DACA recipients are known, with the recent arrest of a    Mexican immigrant in Washington State, Daniel Ramirez. Immigration agents arrested him when they went to his house to detain his father, a convicted drug trafficker. They said Mr. Ramirez admitted to having gang affiliations, which cancels the protection offered under DACA. But Mr. Ramirez denies having made the admission, and his lawyers are fighting his deportation. A program known as 287( g) named for its section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows the Department of Homeland Security to train local and state law enforcement officers to work as de facto federal immigration officers, identifying undocumented immigrants in their communities and jails and turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. From 2006 to 2013, the program led to 175, 000 deportations, according to federal statistics. But investigations and court rulings revealed an ugly side effect: In some jurisdictions, local officers were using their authority to racially profile Latinos. One of the most egregious cases was in Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous, during the tenure of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, who a federal judge ruled had discriminated against Latinos in patrols and other enforcement efforts. The Obama administration curtailed the use of the program, which currently involves 32 agencies in 16 states. The Trump administration wants more agencies to take part, and some have already expressed a desire to do so. The administration is trying to significantly expand the amount of information available on the enforcement of immigration laws and, in particular, unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will establish a new office to work with the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom appeared with Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The office, known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will provide victims with information about defendants’ immigration status and whether they are in jail. Significantly, funding for the office comes from reallocating “any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens” by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases. The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails. That is a clear shot across the bow at   sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, contending that turning in unauthorized immigrants would destroy the fragile relationship that the police have with immigrant communities. “We are going to continue our policy that has been in place because we think that it helps us have a safer, stronger, better community,” Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse said on Tuesday. The Trump administration is already pondering ways to punish those cities by denying them some federal aid. “Now everyone is going to be able to see how many criminal aliens are being released as a result of the sanctuary policies,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. In January 2009, the departing Bush administration extended some Privacy Act rights, which American citizens and legal permanent residents already had, to undocumented immigrants. That meant that information obtained by one agency, like the Internal Revenue Service or Citizenship and Immigration Services, could not generally be shared with other agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One rationale for the move was to protect the personal information of immigrants who might one day become citizens covered by the Privacy Act. The Trump administration has now rescinded those privacy protections. One of the memos released on Tuesday said that those protections had been detrimental to the families of the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, because those families could not get information about such defendants’ legal status, or whether they had been deported, leaving victims “feeling marginalized and without a voice. ” The Department of Homeland Security said it would develop new rules on the sharing of undocumented immigrants’ private information. But advocates for unauthorized immigrants said they feared that immigrants who had applied for legal status  —   in the process divulging they were not here legally  —   were now in danger of having that information used to deport them. “The constitution doesn’t traditionally allow bait and switches,” said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an organization that advocates for immigrants. “These are folks who submitted their information attempting to play by the rules, with part of the rules being that the government would protect their privacy. ” The memos released on Tuesday repeat Mr. Trump’s demand in his executive order for a larger enforcement force that can speed up the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States. In practice, that may play out more slowly than the president might prefer. The source of this caution is none other than John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15, 000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years. “I’d rather have fewer and make sure that they’re   people,” Mr. Kelly told lawmakers. “I will not skimp on the training and the standards. ” On top of the stringent hiring standards and training, Border Patrol applicants are required to take a polygraph test, which nearly 60 percent fail. A previous surge in hiring under President George W. Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases, with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.",0

56,Trump Fans Rally Across the Nation to Support the President - The New York Times,Jack Healy,"DENVER  —   As Americans poured into airport terminals, public squares and congressional town   meetings over the past month to vent their anger over President Trump’s policies, Debbie Dooley started hearing from fellow conservatives. “Phone call after phone call from people: ‘Why aren’t we out supporting President Trump? ’” said Ms. Dooley, a Tea Party activist in Georgia. So on Monday, conservatives around the country got out the Make America Great Again hats, unfurled American flags and held rallies at state capitols and on courthouse steps, seeking to rekindle the populist fervor that helped vault Mr. Trump to the White House and stick up for a president whose approval ratings have taken a beating during five   weeks in office. But the modest crowds that showed up for the noontime rallies from New Jersey to Georgia to Colorado offered a reminder of what liberal groups learned eight years ago in the face of Tea Party anger at President Barack Obama: Stoking   energy is often easier for the outraged resistance than for the party pulling the levers in Washington. “I’m getting a lot of comments from the leftists about, ‘Your crowd’s not going to be as big as our crowd,’” said Betty Blanco, a retired teacher from La Junta, Colo. on the state’s conservative eastern plains, who organized a rally on the steps of the   State Capitol. “I didn’t know it was a contest. ” About 150 Trump supporters turned out for Monday’s rally in Denver, held just across the street from a park that had swelled with tens of thousands of protesters as part of the Women’s March on Jan. 21. Organizers said Monday’s rallies, held a day before the president addresses a joint session of Congress, bubbled up organically from Trump supporters who felt he was being treated unfairly by Democrats and the news media. Some people said the ferocity of that criticism had actually nudged them closer to Mr. Trump. “I was mad at Trump for a while, absolutely,” said Steve Foose, a bus driver in Middletown, N. J. and   former Democrat who joined about 200 people waving signs and flags along the curb of a   crossroads. “I just grew to like him, and I would lay down my life for him. ” Monday’s rallies were filled with prayer, choruses of “God Bless America” and speeches about cutting taxes and regulations. People applauded the president and veterans, and urged one another to stay positive. But there were also chants of “Lock her up!” every so often, and a few shouting matches when Trump critics wandered by and yelled at the crowds. People praised Mr. Trump for actions that have provoked protests and lawsuits from the left. In interviews at five rallies on Monday, his supporters said that he was breaking the china in Washington, cracking down on immigration and supporting American businesses, and that they were getting frustrated that more people did not seem to see it that way. In Atlanta, Jermane Enoch, 57, a project manager from Powder Springs, Ga. was among the few   in a largely white crowd of 200 who rallied on the president’s behalf at Liberty Plaza, in the shadow of the State Capitol. Wearing a red Trump hat, a patriotic bow tie and a Trump   Mr. Enoch said that good businesspeople would understand why Monday’s rallies across the country were needed, given what he said was the “negative messaging” from   protesters and the news media. “It’s necessary to have a show of continuous support, just like it’s necessary for businesses to show continuous improvement,” he said. Mr. Enoch argued that the president had been mischaracterized and misunderstood. The idea that Mr. Trump is a racist, as some critics contend, struck him as balderdash. In a   turn at the microphone, Mr. Enoch said his support for Mr. Trump superseded race, and he urged a return to conservative values. Mr. Enoch brandished a pocket Constitution, to much applause. And he took a cue from Isaiah as he said Mr. Trump’s supporters should not be cowed by counterprotest: “I am not afraid!” he said. “No weapon that is formed against us shall prosper!” RICHARD FAUSSET In Mandeville, a city in one of Louisiana’s most conservative parishes, there was some question as to how many Trump supporters would materialize, this being the usually quiet eve of Mardi Gras. But there was little doubt that those who showed up  —   150 or so bikers, retirees,   police officers and others  —   would be   in their support for a president who won the parish by roughly three to one. A home remodeler and disc jockey who uses the name Bobby Blaze made the most   entrance, wearing a suit over his leather “Brotherhood of Bikers” vest, a bright red tie with a gold clip and, to top it all off, a   Trump wig. He said that his father, a World War II veteran who died two years ago, would have loved Mr. Trump: “‘The country needs John Wayne,’ that’s what he used to say. ” And after aiding its allies around the globe for decades, Mr. Blaze suggested, the United States had finally gotten such a   leader at a time when it needed him most. “We can’t help the world,” he said, “till we can help ourselves first. ” CAMPBELL ROBERTSON In Cabarrus County, N. C. which Mr. Trump easily carried, more than 150 of his supporters met up outside the courthouse in Concord, many of them unfurling last year’s Trump campaign flags, lawn signs and red caps  —   though a surprising number said they had never attended a Trump rally during the presidential race. Bill Cagle, a retiree, decided to attend on Monday after seeing a deluge of news coverage of   demonstrations in the streets and at congressional town halls. “I said, ‘Well, we’ve been silent long enough, and we’ve really got to say what’s in the heart,’ when I saw all of this vitriol the last six weeks,” Mr. Cagle said. An operations manager for a company that builds towers for   lines, Mr. Cagle said he was a registered Democrat but had not voted for the party’s presidential ticket in decades. He said he maintained his registration only to vote against what he considered the worst option in a primary race. “What he’s done in a little bit of time, I think is great,” he said of Mr. Trump, noting in particular his efforts to roll back regulations. “I’ve been in business, and by golly, if they can get rid of some of that, it’s great. ” TRIP GABRIEL On the edges of the Denver crowd, two men exemplified the devotion and the dread that the president inspires. Ron Kamstra, a retired civil engineer and   Christian who said he deeply supported Mr. Trump’s stances on terrorism and immigration, handed out photocopied passages of the Quran that he said encouraged violence. Mohamed Mashkooke, an accountant born in Somalia, wandered up to Mr. Kamstra and said he was growing increasingly worried about becoming the target of racist attacks  —   like the shooting last week of two Indian men in Kansas. Cordially at first, but then increasingly tensely, the men argued about religion, immigration, faith and the validity of Mr. Obama’s birth certificate. (Despite all of the facts, Mr. Kamstra is still dubious.) “I don’t hate Trump,” Mr. Mashkooke said finally, walking away, “but I think he’s crazy. ” “O. K. good,” Mr. Kamstra replied, and turned back to the speeches. JACK HEALY",0
57,Fox Biz Reporter Can't Help But Bash Clinton’s Rally After Covering Trump’s Packed Event Day Before,Kayla Brandon,"Share on Twitter 
The battle of campaign rallies has been going strong throughout the 2016 presidential election, with both candidates amassing pretty large crowds. 
Just last month, the Washington Post compared two separate September rallies for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. 
Trump's had a crowd of 15,000, at his Sept. 27th rally in Melbourne, Florida: Unbelievable evening in Melbourne, Florida w/ 15,000 supporters- and an additional 12,000 who could not get in.

It appears as though Fox Business reporter Adam Shapiro felt the need to compare Trump and Hillary's crowd attendance, too. 
At a West Palm Beach rally Wednesday, Shapiro said there appeared to be roughly a thousand Hillary supporters at Palm Beach State College, which was a sizable difference to Trump's rally the day before: 
""It's nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump — 15,000. 
Take a look, Stewart [camera pans crowd]. 
There's maybe 1,000 to 2,000 people here today. The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there's empty space here."" Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
He just couldn't stop talking about it, adding that if they were covering a Trump rally, the room would be “packed.” 
Though Shapiro took a dig at the Democratic nominee for her apparently “empty” rally, those who were in attendance still sang “Happy Birthday” to her. ",1
58,11 Fiction Podcasts Worth a Listen - The New York Times,Amanda Hess,"The fiction podcast is having a moment. But modern audio dramatists have been turning out intriguing scripted podcasts for several years, and they’re showing no signs of slowing down. Take a guided tour through the past, present and future of audio drama with these fictional standouts. “The Truth” bills itself as “movies for your ears. ” This anthology series, which tells stories through subtle sound effects and naturalistic acting, was ahead of its time at its 2012 debut. Typically, each episode places new characters into short capsule tales. But recently “The Truth” introduced an   series, “Songonauts,” about musicians in a struggling band who are unexpectedly transported into their own songs. Listen here. “Welcome to Night Vale,” which also began in 2012, takes the form of a darkly funny radio show, broadcast from a town where every conspiracy theory is true. Its   vibe  —   just a narrator, a script and some music  —   is matched by its bizarre storytelling form. At first, listening to “Welcome to Night Vale” feels like tuning into a disoriented beat poetry session, but with every episode, listeners get drawn closer into this community, its characters and their strange dealings. Listen here. “Limetown” is a 2015 podcast that follows the story of a radio reporter with American Public Radio, who sets out to solve the sudden and mysterious disappearance of 300 people in a Tennessee town. Though it’s one of several fictional podcasts released last year to borrow the aesthetics of the   podcast “Serial,” this one is still an exciting debut from   Productions, an upstart fiction podcast studio that’s poised to expand with a slate of scripted series next year. Listen here. “The Message” is the first fiction series to come out of a partnership between the   podcast network Panoply and the sponsor, General Electric. The collaboration is branded G. E. Podcast Theater, harking back to the old, Ronald   radio and television anthology series General Electric Theater. “The Message” felt more moneyed than many of early fiction podcasts, boasting cinematic sound design and a tense plot that felt borrowed from peak TV, and it was rewarded with a No. 1 slot on the iTunes charts last year. Listen here. “Alice Isn’t Dead,” a haunting new tale from the creators of “Welcome to Night Vale,” was released earlier this year under their new podcast imprint, Night Vale Presents. “Alice Isn’t Dead” follows a woman as she sets out on a frightening and fantastical road trip in an effort to track down her missing wife. Listen here. “The Orbiting Human Circus (of the Air),” the latest offering from Night Vale Presents, is a surreal series set in the world of an absurdist   variety show. Created by Julian Koster of the band Neutral Milk Hotel, the series features John Cameron Mitchell alongside guest stars like Tim Robbins (who voices a cricket) and Mandy Patinkin (who sings). Listen here. “A Night Called Tomorrow” stars James Urbaniak, the actor and host of the beloved monthly podcast “Getting On. ” This noirish scripted series, which also features comedy luminaries like Andy Richter and “Weird Al” Yankovic, is being released exclusively through Howl, an audio subscription service that offers up dozens of nonfiction podcasts, original fiction pieces and comedy albums for $4. 99 a month. Listen here. “Fruit” comes from the mind of Issa Rae  —   the creative force behind the YouTube series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl” and the new HBO comedy “Insecure. ” It tells the intimate story of an athlete, known only as “X,” who grapples with issues of sexuality in the hypermasculine world of pro football. This is another Howl subscription offering Season 2 had its debut last month. Listen here. “LifeAfter,” the second scripted series from Panoply and GE Podcast Theater, is a   piece that plays with ideas of life, death and artificial intelligence.

59,Mike Birbiglia’s 6 Tips for Making It Small in Hollywood. Or Anywhere. - The New York Times,Mike Birbiglia,"This summer, I went on a   tour with my movie “Don’t Think Twice,” a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when one member is plucked for a “Saturday Night Live” type of show. At every Q. and A. session for the movie, people would ask the same question: “If I want to be a comedian [or actor or writer or improviser or film director] how do I get started?” The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask  —   I make small films, small   shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix  —   but I’m the person who showed up to talk to them. And now I’m the person offering you unsolicited advice  —   so if you don’t need it or want it, this is not for you. Anyway, I’ve boiled my answer down to six ideas. 1. DON’T WAIT Write. Make a short film. Go to an open mike. Take an improv class. There’s no substitute for actually doing something. Don’t talk about it anymore. Maybe don’t even finish reading this essay. 2. FAIL Don’t worry about failing. There’s a great video where Ira Glass explains that when you start in a new field, your work won’t be as good as your taste. It will take years for your taste and the quality of your work to intersect. (If ever!) Failure is essential. There’s no substitute for it. It’s not just encouraged but required. The bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts. Maybe 20. I wrote 12 drafts of “Don’t Think Twice,” 14 drafts of my first movie, “Sleepwalk With Me,” and worked on my first   show for six years. My first   set on “Late Show With David Letterman” in 2002 was mined from three hours of   material that I had tried and failed with for six years. 3. LEARN FROM THE FAILURE This is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect. People who have good taste. People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is. They might be in a theater company, at an improv school, or live in your dorm. They aren’t the easiest thing to find. When I was in college, every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggie’s Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away, to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians. It sucked. People didn’t like my comedy there. I didn’t love theirs. It wasn’t a fit. But then I got a job working as a door person at the DC Improv comedy club in Washington, and that was a fit. Around the same time, I was cast in my college improv group. So all at once, I met people whom I could bounce jokes and ideas off of. They’d give me candid feedback, and I tried to listen. I wasn’t great at it at first. It’s hard to hear criticism. But I’ve learned that harsh feedback, constructive feedback, even weird, random feedback, is all helpful, if you know the essence of what you’re trying to convey. I once heard an interview where Ron Howard said that he tests the rough cuts of his movies with a ton of audiences. He doesn’t do it to be told what the movie’s vision should be, but to understand whether his vision is coming across. If not, he makes changes. Your vision is not being conveyed a majority of the time. With “Don’t Think Twice,” I workshopped the script like the way I workshop my standup: I invited friends over to read it out loud in my living room and then fed them pizza. The pizza was excellent. The script often wasn’t. So I’d get my friends all drunk on pizza and then ask them hard questions like: “What do you like least about the script? Be honest. I can take it. ” That’s where I learned the most. 4. MAYBE QUIT You might not be meant to be a writer or performer or improviser. You might be meant to teach kids math or raise money for a food bank or start a company that makes Rubik’s Cubes for babies. Don’t rule out quitting. There is going to be an insane amount of work ahead, and your time might be spent better elsewhere. There was a great column in The New York Times recently where Angela Duckworth writes, “Rather than ask, ‘What do I want to be when I grow up?’ ask, ‘In what way do I wish the world were different? What problem can I help solve?’ This puts the focus where it should be  —   on how you can serve other people. ” 5. BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THAT’S SMALL BUT GREAT Eight years ago, I made a network sitcom pilot based on my life. It was a dream come true. A sitcom about my life? What could be better than that for a standup comedian? Well, it didn’t get picked up. I was devastated. But here’s the kicker: Failing to get that sitcom was the single greatest stroke of luck that’s happened in my entire career. The show wasn’t truly my comedic voice. It was watered down by network and studio notes to the point of being like dozens of other bland sitcoms. After that, I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers. The networks. The studios. Since then, I’ve created a handful of pieces for “This American Life,”   three Off Broadway   shows, toured hundreds of cities around the world, and written, directed and starred in two feature films. All outside the system. Based on that work, I’ve been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system. Which is to say: Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system, hopefully on your own terms. The point is, forget the gatekeepers. As far as I’m concerned, what you create in a       improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being   by seven million people. America doesn’t need more stuff. We need more great stuff. You could make that. 6. CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED, AND HEART IS UNDERRATED Plus, there are fewer people competing for heart, so you have a better chance of getting noticed. Sometimes people say, “One thing you have to offer in your work is yourself. ” I disagree. I think it’s the only thing.",0
60,Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline: ‘The Last Gasp Of This Economic Cycle Will Come In 2018’,Mac Slavo,"It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the U.S. economy will collapse. That, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given. 
The only question now is “when” that moment will come. 
According to Christine Hughes, chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital , it will be very soon. Basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, Hughes says in her latest update to clients that we’re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 – 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 . 
First, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months: 
Hughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning: 
As the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. So let’s assume we’re like every other time in history and that happens. Then it moves forward to 2018… 
So, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. We’re closing in on 2016 now… we basically have a year… maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. 
So if you are levered personally or corporately… if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuff… the Canadian housing market comes to mind… You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself. 
Watch the video report: 
Wolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important: 
Since early July, the 30-year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 8.3%. It’s now called “the rout” in longer-dated government bonds. One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields. 
What has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? The US Treasury yield curve. It drives bank lending – which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. 
We know it is only a matter of time at this point. 
Greg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: 
So, when the debt bubble bursts we’re going to get a correction in population. It’s a mathematical certainty. 
Millions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. And I’m saying when not if… 
… 
When resources become more and more scarce we’re going to see countries at war with each other. People will be scrambling… in a worst case scenario… doing everything that they can to survive… to provide for their family and for themselves. 
There’s no way out of it. 
If Mannarino and Hughes are right, you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse .

61,"Venezuela Muzzles Legislature, Moving Closer to One-Man Rule - The New York Times",Nicholas Casey and Patricia Torres,"IQUITOS, Peru  —   Venezuela took its strongest step yet toward   rule under the leftist President Nicolás Maduro as his loyalists on the Supreme Court seized power from the National Assembly in a ruling late Wednesday night. The ruling effectively dissolved the elected legislature, which is led by Mr. Maduro’s opponents, and allows the court to write laws itself, experts said. The move caps a year in which the last vestiges of Venezuela’s democracy have been torn down, critics and regional leaders say, leaving what many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime, but an outright dictatorship. “What we have warned of has finally come to pass,” said Luis Almagro, the head of the Organization of American States, a regional diplomacy group that includes Venezuela and is investigating the country for violating the bloc’s Democratic Charter. Mr. Almagro called the move a “  coup,” a term used in Latin America to denote takeovers typical of the 1990s in Guatemala and Peru  —   but virtually   in the region today. Recent months have seen a swift consolidation of power by Mr. Maduro as scores of political prisoners have been detained without trial, protesters violently repressed and local elections postponed. In taking power from the National Assembly, the ruling removed what most consider to be the only remaining counterbalance to the president’s growing power in the country. The court said that lawmakers were “in a situation of contempt,” and that while that lasted, the justices themselves would step in to “ensure that parliamentary powers were exercised directly by this chamber, or by the body that the chamber chooses. ” It did not say whether it might hand power back. Members of the National Assembly denounced the ruling on Thursday. “They have kidnapped the Constitution, they have kidnapped our rights, they have kidnapped our liberty,” said Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the body, holding a crumpled copy of the ruling before reporters on Thursday. Oneida Guaipe, an opposition lawmaker from the country’s central coast, said the body would continue to do its work, even if its laws would now be ignored when it produced legislation. “This is demonstrating before the world the authoritarianism here,” she said. “The people chose us through a popular vote. ” The ruling was also a challenge to Venezuela’s neighbors, which met in Washington this week to put pressure on the country to hold elections, and to discuss a possible expulsion of Venezuela from the O. A. S. on the grounds that the country is not democratic. Last week, the United States, Canada and a dozen of Latin America’s largest nations called for Mr. Maduro to recognize the National Assembly’s powers, a rare joint statement that reflected deep impatience with his government. “We consider it a serious setback for democracy in Venezuela,” the United States State Department said on Thursday of the court decision. Peru withdrew its ambassador in protest. David Smilde, an analyst from the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said it might now be up to Venezuela’s neighbors to encourage the country to hold elections again, given resistance from within the government. “The Maduro government seems to have no intention of respecting the basic elements of electoral democracy,” he said. Critics say a long litany of other moves by the government are taking a toll on Venezuela’s democracy. Perhaps most visible to Venezuelans was an effort last year to hold a recall referendum against the president, whose popularity is sinking along with the country’s collapsing economy. While such a referendum was permitted by the country’s Constitution, and highly favored in polls, Mr. Maduro alternatively called the effort illegal or a coup staged by his opponents. In October, a lower court suspended the process on the grounds that there had been irregularities in the gathering of signatures. Meanwhile, political prisoners continued to be arrested. In January, Mr. Maduro established a new “  commando” to round up political dissidents accused of treason. The group has taken aim at members of the opposition, arresting many, including a city councilman from central Venezuela and a deputy lawmaker in the National Assembly. In February, after CNN en Español, the network’s Spanish language channel, broadcast an investigation that linked Venezuela’s vice president to a passport fraud scheme in the Middle East, Mr. Maduro ordered the channel off the air. The government has blocked the Caracas bureau chief of The New York Times from entering the country since October. But to many, the gradual assault against the National Assembly, more than a year in the making, was the most telling sign of democratic erosion in Venezuela. “It has come in fragments,” Carlos Ayala Corao, a Venezuelan lawyer and legal analyst, said of the court’s actions against the legislature. “They have been slicing it in pieces. ” The conflicts began in December 2015, when rising grievances about the country’s faltering economy propelled Mr. Maduro’s opposition to win control of the legislature. It was the first time in years that the chamber was not dominated by the movement founded by the former leftist President Hugo Chávez. Mr. Maduro initially said he accepted the vote. He even appeared before opposition lawmakers to give his annual address on the state of the government in January of last year. But the Supreme Court, packed with loyalists to Mr. Maduro shortly before the National Assembly took power, was chipping away at the chamber’s powers. It refused to let it seat four lawmakers on the grounds that there had been voting irregularities. That denied the opposition of a supermajority, which would have given it expanded powers over Mr. Maduro. The National Assembly went back and forth on the ruling, but eventually complied. As the National Assembly began to get to work, it continued to clash with the court. By last spring, the legislature had written laws delivering on campaign promises like one measure to invigorate the economy and another to free more than 100 political prisoners, only to see the court overturn them as unconstitutional. When Mr. Maduro tried to increase his own powers under a state of emergency that he declared, the legislature rejected the effort. But the court sided with the president. In October, the court stripped the National Assembly of its power to review the annual budget, leaving Mr. Maduro in charge of the country’s purse strings. More recently, legislators tried to block the president from pursuing oil ventures without their approval. In Wednesday’s ruling stripping the National Assembly of its lawmaking powers, the court said the president had the right to make these oil deals. It said its ruling was justified by the Assembly’s choice to keep the lawmakers onboard whose elections had been questioned earlier. This act, it said, rendered the Assembly itself invalid. With few protesters in the streets of Caracas on Thursday, it was unclear what popular support the opposition might get from the public. Analysts say many Venezuelans feel as dispirited by the opposition as by leftist leaders, given the opposition’s continued defeat by the government. Opposition leaders called for protests on Saturday and in the coming week but have been unable to draw large crowds since last fall. John Magdaleno, a political consultant, said he expected a wider crackdown against the opposition from Mr. Maduro in coming weeks, and possibly more arrests. “In my opinion, from now on, there will be growing pressures against lawmakers,” he said, “and it’s probable there will be much greater persecution of political leaders. ”",0
62,"Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate",Natural News Editors,"Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate 
  Natural News Editors Tags: war on women , democrats , campaign tactic (NaturalNews) Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasn't so effective in election after election. We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a ""War on Women.""(Article written by John Howard, republished from Breitbart.com )Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of ""Strange New Respect"" for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism — and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Left's revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they're tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an out-of-touch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about ""binders full of women ,"" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. [1, 2]In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill's hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to ""journalist"" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.It's all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. There's precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trump's policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin' Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal ""independence"" through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (You're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.) [3]The great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the ""implicit bias"" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.Read more at: Breitbart.com",1

64,White House Confirms More Gitmo Transfers Before Obama Leaves Office,Edwin Mora,"President Barack Obama will likely release more prisoners from the U. S. military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, before incoming    Donald Trump takes over on January 20, the White House press secretary reiterated on Thursday. [That same day, reports confirmed that the U. S. transferred four detainees to Saudi Arabia.  The Daily Mail has placed the number of 11th hour transfers at 22, including the four recently sent to Saudi Arabia, adding that the group of prisoners who are expected to be released will include jihadists who have threatened to behead and bomb Americans. Prior to the Daily Mail article and recent transfers, the number of prisoners who are expected to be set free by the time Obama leaves the White House varied by news agencies, ranging from 17 to 19, a move that would reduce the current detainee population at the Guantánamo facility to between 40 and 42. On Thursday, Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters: I am not able to speak to any specific detainee transfers between now and January 20th other than to confirm for you that there are likely to be some.  And whenever those transfers take place, once they have been completed, we announce them publicly.  And that will continue to be our approach through January 20th.  And my expectation is that there will be some additional announcements of that type. Asked about the risk of detainees   in terrorist activity against the United States, Earnest boasted that only nine of the prisoners transferred since Obama took office have been confirmed by the intelligence community as having returned to militant activity, compared to 21 percent (113 of 532) under the previous administration, a figure often touted by Democrats. However, Earnest failed to mention that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) figure (nine) that he highlights refers to   as of July 2016, when 161 detainees had been released by Obama, not the 183 he mentioned on Thursday. The nine confirmed   includes one deceased detainee and accounts for six percent of the 161 prisoners who had been released under Obama as of July 2016. Moreover, the number of prisoners released before 2009 exceeds those liberated under Obama more than   (3. 3) which may account for the higher rate of confirmed   under George W. Bush. The White House spokesman attributed the low percentage of   under Obama to the president’s     panel, known as the Periodic Review Board (PRB) that has cleared for release all the prisoners transferred out after 2009, including   “forever prisoners,” or those believed to be too dangerous to release. “Since President Obama took office, and since these reforms were initiated, nine detainees have been confirmed by the intelligence community of reengaging in the fight,” Earnest said on Thursday. “Considering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obama’s time in office, a little     math would indicate that our percentage is much better, and it’s a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office. ” According to ODNI, 20 out of 161 detainees (12 percent) had been confirmed (nine) or suspected (11) to have returned to terrorist activities under Obama’s watch as of July 2016. Under the Bush administration, 188 out of 532 (35 percent) are confirmed (113) or suspected (75) to have   in terrorism. When taken as a whole, if there were 20 detainees confirmed or suspected to have   in terrorism for every 161 detainees released under Bush like during the Obama administration, the overall rate of terror returnees before 2009 would be closer to 40 percent, not 35. In late December, the Chicago Tribune, citing U. S. officials, reported that the Obama administration has shared its plans with Congress to transfer out as many as 19 detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Of the 55 prisoners still held at Gitmo, 18 have been cleared for release by Obama’s PRB and more than half (27) are considered “forever prisoners,” or too dangerous to release. Nevertheless, Obama has already released prisoners who had been designated too dangerous to release. The remaining 10 prisoners are believed to still be undergoing war crimes proceedings at military commissions, including at least six who were facing death penalty tribunals as of late last year. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that four detainees  —   Salem Ahmad Hadi Bin Kanad, Muhammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanim, Abdallah Yahya Yusif   and Muhammad Ali Abdallah Muhammad Bwazir  —   had been transferred to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All four detainees are from   Yemen, which shares a border with Saudi Arabia. At least two individuals  —   Kanad and Ghanim  —   had been linked to the Taliban when they were apprehended and taken to the Guantánamo prison, also known as Gitmo. Meanwhile, the    Bwazir has been directly linked to Osama bin Laden.   also affiliated with   was born in Saudi Arabia, but is a citizen of Yemen, according to the U. S. military. In December 2007, the U. S. military deemed him “a HIGH risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests and allies. ”",0
65,The Geometry of Energy and Meditation of Buddha,nan,"License DMCA 
A mandala is a visual symbol often utilized in meditation practices and teachings. The mandala symbol itself is a geometric construction of points, lines, planes and solids symbolizing the universe. Mandalas are geometric designs depictive of the universe specifically. Other designs are similarly meditation tools, but may not be mandalas specifically. The visually conceived geometric symbols are visual meditation tools. A visual meditation tool is called a yantra. Mandalas and all other yantras are visual meditation points of concentration. Yantras are visual meditative tools similar in value to points of concentration. The image above is the sri yantra, sri meaning king or most important. 
A mantra is the audio version of a mandala. A mantra is an audio meditation tool. Whether the sound of the mantra is a single syllable tone or a series of lengthy metaphysical musings, a mantra is an audio meditation tool. Mantras, as sound vibration, are wavy linear vibrations of connection. 
The terms asana and mudra both reference physical positioning. An asana is a body posture as a meditation tool, and a mudra is a hand gesture or posture as a meditation tool. Asanas and mudras enable our own bodies to become a geometric representation of a meditation tool. The postures are physical meditation tools transforming self into one's own geometric figure or plane among the space and sensitive to the space of self and surroundings. 
Tantra means unification, or looming/weaving together principles and practices, instruction and individual action. Tantra unites entirety. Tantra signifies confluence and integration; a fusion. It is Sanskrit for loom, the device which weaves together string into cloth. It is an ancient word with many properties and has been variously used to describe the knots of strings weaved together in a rug, and the cord on which sacred mala bead necklaces were strung, (Mala beads are Tibetan prayer necklaces of 108 beads used to assist mentally or vocally repeating a mantra 108 times.) and practices of unification of individual with the universal. Today the word tantra is often used in reference to the union of lovemaking. Though there is also a specific type of yoga called Tantra Yoga it means unification. 
There is the potentiation of the unification of principle and practice. There is the potentiation of tantra of yantra, mantra and asana. And there is certainly the lesson of the potentiation of Yin Yang tantra. The combination of Yin and Yang potentials and energies within leads to all sorts of aspects of development. This can be energetically understood in the idea that there are only two types of energies, straight and circular, straight for Yang potentials and circular for Yin potentials. It can be understood on a tangible level that rest and work are both required. When straight and circular energies combine, a spiral results. A spiral is one of, if not the highest expressions of energy. 
More broadly and generally, tantra notes a mutually accepted connection, a tied knot of intertwined being, like lovemaking, but not necessarily beginning with or limited to the act of lovemaking. Humanity itself is a tantra; a fused weaving knot or many strings, of many instructions and many individuals. - Advertisement - 
Essentially tantra is spiritual understanding of the relationship and connections between individuation and universal energies. An ancient spiritual philosophy preceding both Buddhism and Hinduism, tantra represents integration, unifying the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universal and the individual, the feminine and the masculine, the Yin and the Yang. It also refers to integrative knowledge and its continuation and building refinement through the interaction of teacher and student, signifying union and fusion; the acceptance, integration and transmutation of knowledge between individuals, like the string of life. 
Tantric ideas enhance and explore metaphysical merging of ideas and energies. Tantra is the merging of the physical and spiritual, through the merging of the conceptual. In essence, Tantra is the integration of yantra (the philosophy of visual symbols), mantra (communication of audio symbolism) and mudra (our very physical posturing) each of which is important on their own and increasing so when intertwined aspects of yoga, and life. Tantra unites meditation practices and enhances the individual unity expansion with entirety of the universal. 
There is not necessarily the need for a specific yantra, or specific mantra, or specific asana in meditation, however each are tools that can be used and considered, and most are most powerful when practiced in unified tantric manner, or tantric mind state. A tantric mind state recognizes unity expansion and aims toward it, rather than cultivating a mind state of separation. 
No matter how one approaches meditation the unifying tantra of our meditation principles and practices bring about the unity expansion of yantra no matter. No matter our level of refinement of posture, we are always in an asana, no matter if we utilize mantra, or yantra, we for th most part still see and hear and those who cannot can still concentrate and connect. And no matter the mantra, yantra or asana, it is the principles behind and pertaining to the symbolism that contains the real power, the highest potential for tantric connection. Yantras, mantras and asanas establish your sacred space and sacred perimeter and uniting with entirety in tantric balance. 
Seed of Buddha Meditation - Advertisement - 
One of my favorite meditations relates to the four dimensions of geometry, but is extracted from Buddhist lessons. It is one of the most powerful meditations I have learned and as I learned it, Buddha himself practiced and taught this meditation. I learned this meditation from a Tibetan Buddhist monk from Nepal before I considered the four dimensions of geometry applied to meditation. On later examination however the components of the meditation relate to the four dimensions of geometry. 
This meditation is direct and simple, but can lead to infinitely complex profound lessons. The profundity of each of the ideas in this meditation cannot be understated. And each of the concepts has been elaborated on endlessly for centuries since Buddha, and so the presentation here is of course a simplification of the ideas and processes that might be endlessly explored and refined. And that is what meditation is all about really, our own personal inward exploration and refinement. 
To begin, sit in a comfortable cross legged position on a meditation pillow. Sit for a time to simply settle into absorption and relaxation, focusing on the breath. The rhythm of the following meditation consists of mindfulness of an idea followed by mindfulness of no idea, where as much as possible we think on nothingness. The nothingness gives us a chance to relax, compared to processing the series of ideas which can all be quite intense. The process can be done in any time period. The point is to cover each idea as deeply as can be, given time or mental state circumstances. 
The meditation is formed from important Buddhist concepts. Many meditations are derived from such teachings, Buddhist and otherwise, so that there are lessons in a sense for the secular, and meditation practitioners.",1
66,Poll: Most Voters Have Not Heard of Democratic 2020 Election Candidates - Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,"There is a minefield of potential 2020 election candidates in the Democratic Party waiting to challenge President Trump, but most voters have not heard of many of them, according to a new poll. [The   Consult poll asked 1, 990 registered voters their views on 19 potential Democratic challengers to Trump’s presidency.  The list of potential candidates identified in the survey includes eight senators, five governors, a mayor of a large city, a congressman, two CEOs, a former vice president, and a failed Senate candidate. Of those mentioned in the survey, half of the respondents did not know most of the candidates. “All bets are off when it comes to the composition of the 2020 Democratic primary,” said Morning Consult   and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. “This early polling indicates that many of the names being floated in Washington still have a lot of work to do in terms of building national profiles. ” Most survey respondents were able to identify and have opinions on former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ( ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ).   of the voters surveyed said they knew enough about Biden and Warren to have formed opinions about the candidates. Sanders was not included in the survey. According to Morning Consult, Biden was the most popular candidate of the list of potential 2020 Democratic candidates, with 74 percent of respondents having a positive view of the former vice president. Warren came in second, with 51 percent of respondents viewing her favorably. The number of those rumored to be potential Democratic candidates for the 2020 election pales in comparison to the list of people who have filed to run for president so   129 people have filed to run for the presidency in 2020.",0
67,Migrants Confront Judgment Day Over Old Deportation Orders - The New York Times,Vivian Yee,"There are a little more than two weeks between Juan, an electrician in the Bronx, and the date he cannot forget: March 21, 2017, at 8 a. m. when the federal government has told him to report for deportation. Two weeks to decide: Avoid it, and try to preserve the American life he has built for a little longer, even as a fugitive. Go, and lose it all: his wife and son, his job, his apartment, his world. “I would feel like an animal if I stay here and hide,” said Juan, 29, who asked that his last name not be used. “I want to prove that I can follow the laws. I want to make my case at this meeting, but I know that if I go, they’re going to deport me. ” In an immigration system mottled with escape hatches and hobbled by scant resources, Juan, who fled Colombia six years ago, is one of nearly a million people who have managed to linger in the United States despite having been ordered out of the country by an immigration judge  —   some of them more than a decade ago. And with the Trump administration intent on sweeping perhaps millions of immigrants without legal status out of the country, the White House has not had to look far to make a quick mark. Because people with deportation orders have had their day in court, most of them can be sent out of the country without seeing a judge, sometimes within hours of being arrested. “People who have been ordered deported and who are still here are the   fruit,” said Stephen   an immigration law professor at Cornell University. “Trump has said he has wanted to deport more people. The easiest way to get those numbers up are to take those people who’ve been ordered deported and go after them. ” President Trump’s immigration agency has already offered what looks like a preview: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently deported to Mexico an Arizona  mother who had been ordered out of the country four years ago. But the   will be complicated. The backlog of what the government calls “fugitive aliens” has persisted through Republican and Democratic administrations, inflamed conservatives who oppose illegal immigration, and resisted the immigration authorities’ attempts at enforcement. Since 2006, even as the overall total of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has dipped, the number facing outstanding deportation orders has grown by more than half, to around 962, 000 people from 632, 726. More than half of them come from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. (Another 13, 200 or so, as of early February, were already in the custody of customs officials.) Despite the Bush and Obama administrations’   commitments to focus on expelling those who pose a serious danger to their communities, slightly less than one in five people facing deportation has been convicted of a crime in the United States. The causes for delays can vary. Deportations have been deferred for humanitarian reasons  —   like allowing mothers to stay with sick children in the United States  —   or they have been frozen while an appeal is mounted. The Obama administration put off deportations for thousands of immigrants it did not consider priorities, including Juan, the Bronx electrician, and Guadalupe García de Rayos, the Arizona mother, often   people with strong ties to their communities. “Felons, not families criminals, not children,” President Barack Obama said in 2014, describing the kinds of people he wanted deported. The government also postponed deportations for people who were likely to face torture if they were sent back. Some deportations are simply impossible to carry out: About a quarter of the immigrants with outstanding deportation orders come from countries that refuse to take back deportees, including China, Haiti, Brazil and India. Mr. Trump has threatened to stop issuing visas to people from these countries. In the past, diplomats have urged caution on this front, not wanting to disrupt international relationships over the issue of deportees. And many people under final orders have slipped through gaping cracks in the immigration system. Court notices  —   either mailed to outdated addresses or illegible to Spanish speakers  —   are routinely missed, leaving judges to issue deportation orders for people who miss their chance to argue their case. Nearly a quarter of judges’ decisions rendered in 2015, for example, involved cases where the immigrant in question was absent. The months and, sometimes, years it takes for immigration and asylum cases to wind through a clogged court system can cause the authorities to lose track of immigrants living and working in the country, because they have fled or simply moved. The White House has sought to make it harder for immigrants to be remain free inside the United States while their requests for asylum plod through the courts. They will be detained more often, or asked to wait in Mexico until a judge can rule. “There are all kinds of things in the system that weren’t built to maximize compliance,” said David A. Martin, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and a former immigration official in the Obama and Clinton administrations. It led to a climate, he said, that has prompted many people to not consider a deportation order a serious matter. “And that’s one of the attitudes that sometimes infuriates, with some justification, people who voted for Donald Trump. ” In a significant break from his predecessor, Mr. Trump is directing immigration agents to go after virtually anyone who is in the United States illegally, ending the reprieve for people who had not been considered priorities. “Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed,” one line of Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration reads, with the crispness of a traffic sign. “What has been lacking, up until a month ago, is a willingness and a commitment on the part of the administration to actually do it,” said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter immigration controls. “Nothing is easy,” he said, but going after people who already have deportation orders “will be the easiest part of enforcing the president’s removal priorities. ” President George W. Bush’s administration dented the backlog by deploying fugitive teams that were supposed to track down unauthorized immigrants with deportation orders and criminal records. But the strategy drew a backlash when the raids began snaring undocumented immigrants who were not targets. “That was something that caused a lot of controversy and a lot of anxiety in immigrant communities, because it meant these officers could stop anyone at any time,” said Randy Capps, the director of research at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Mr. Capps added that while the Obama administration narrowed the scope of such raids, he expected the Trump administration to return to the Bush model. There is, of course, an easier way to find some people with final orders: Wait for them to walk into ICE offices for their scheduled appointments. Ms. Rayos was driven across the border within hours of her   in Phoenix, and her deportation has haunted immigrants with coming appointments ever since. But the Trump administration has yet to show a consistent hand. Roxana Orellana Santos, 37, was allowed to walk out of her appointment in Baltimore last week. Ms. Santos, who said she had fled domestic abuse in El Salvador, was arrested in 2008 while eating lunch outdoors, her lawyers say, leading to a civil rights lawsuit that claimed she had been racially profiled. She had been ordered deported two years before that arrest, after she missed an immigration court hearing. Her lawyers said she could not read the notice, which was in English. Ms. Santos’s next appointment is in August. “I don’t feel assured of what the outcome’s going to be next time,” she said, adding that she had asked her brother to help her husband care for her four children if she was deported. In the case of Juan, the electrician, nothing remains to stop the government from acting on the deportation order he first received in 2013. Juan had requested asylum after paramilitary forces in Colombia tried to kill him, he said, but he lost his final appeal the month Mr. Trump was elected president. “I feel hopeless,” Juan said. “My wife is here, my son is here, they are my world. I have nowhere else to run to. I’ve run out of options. I don’t know what to do. ”",0
68,"M.I.T., N.Y.U. and Yale Are Sued Over Retirement Plan Fees - The New York Times",Tara Siegel Bernard,"Three prominent universities were sued on Tuesday, accused of allowing their employees to be charged excessive fees on their retirement savings. The universities  —   the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and Yale  —   each have retirement plans holding more than $3 billion in assets and are being individually sued by a number of their employees in cases seeking   status. The lawyer representing the three groups of plaintiffs, Jerome J. Schlichter, is a pioneer in retirement plan litigation. Over the last decade, he has filed more than 20 lawsuits on behalf of workers in 401( k) retirement plans and has been widely credited with lowering plan fees across corporate America. With the suits filed in federal courts on Tuesday, the focus has turned to a   corner of the retirement savings market, 403( b) plans, which are named for a section of the tax code. The accounts are similar to 401( k) plans, but are offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals. The complaints allege that the universities, as the plan sponsors, failed to monitor excessive fees paid to administer the plans and did not replace more expensive,   investments with cheaper ones. Had the plans eliminated their long lists of investment options and used their bargaining power to cut costs, the complaints argue, participants could have collectively saved tens of millions of dollars. “It is important for retirees and employees of universities to have the same rights and ability to build their retirement assets as employees of   companies,” said Mr. Schlichter, a founding partner of Schlichter Bogard  Denton in St. Louis. “They shouldn’t be penalized. ” In a statement, New York University said that it took the welfare of its faculty and employees seriously, including a dignified retirement. “The retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently. We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail,” said John Beckman, a university spokesman. A spokeswoman for M. I. T. said it did not comment on pending litigation, while Yale said it was “cautious and careful” in administering its plans and would defend itself vigorously. More attention is being paid to investment costs shouldered by American workers, who are less likely today to have pension plans. With the strong support of the Obama administration, the Labor Department introduced new rules in April to strengthen investor protections, requiring a broader group of financial professionals to act in customers’ best interest when handling their retirement money. The aim is to reduce conflicts of interest and the fees consumers pay. Even modest reductions in costs can have a significant effect on retirees’ savings. An   example from the Labor Department: Paying one percentage point more in fees over a   career  —   say 1. 5 percent instead of 0. 5 percent  —   could leave a worker with 28 percent less at retirement. An account with $25, 000  —   and no further contributions for those 35 years  —   would rise to only $163, 000 instead of $227, 000, at an annual rate of 7 percent. Mr. Schlichter said the three universities’ plans were targeted because more people were asking questions about their retirement accounts and “these involve clear breaches of the law. ” The complaint against N. Y. U.  —   which involves two 403( b) plans covering faculty, research administration and the medical school  —   centers largely on costs. The complaint said that participants were offered too many investment choices (there were more than 100 options for faculty) and that many of them were too expensive. The suit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, singles out several investments, including the TIAA Traditional Annuity, which it said has severe restrictions and penalties for withdrawal, as well as variable annuities that have several layers of fees and have historically underperformed. A spokesman for TIAA said it offered   plans and   investments that provide lifetime income. The suit also argues that even the cheapest funds offered could have been provided for less, given the enormous size and bargaining power of the faculty and medical school plans, which together held $4. 2 billion in assets for more than 24, 000 participants at the end of 2014. The complaint alleges that the university did not use its negotiating powers to select a single   record keeper for administrative tasks such as sending statements to employees. It said it also overpaid for these services for many years. The issues concerning Yale’s 403( b) retirement plan  —   which held nearly $3. 6 billion in assets in the spring of 2014  —   follow a similar pattern: multiple record keepers with excessive fees, costing participants millions of dollars over the last six years too many investments of the same style and the use of   funds instead of identical but   ones. That case was filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut. Yale eventually consolidated to one provider, TIAA, in April 2015, and swapped in some   investments, but the suit claims that the changes did not go far enough to fully protect the interests of its employees. Mr. Schlichter said participants were still burdened with sorting through more than 100 options, many of which were too expensive. The complaints lodged against M. I. T. ’s retirement plan (unusually, it is a 401( k) like those used by corporations) are similar but with a twist. The suit alleges that the university, because of its longstanding relationship with nearby Fidelity, did not conduct a thorough search for a plan provider, which might have provided better service for less. The retirement plan offered more than 340 investment options  —   including 180 Fidelity funds  —   until July 2015, when M. I. T. reduced the lineup to 37 options but still retained Fidelity as the record keeper. The complaint said that Fidelity had donated “hundreds of thousands of dollars” to M. I. T. while Abigail Johnson, Fidelity’s chief executive, has served as a member of M. I. T. ’s board of trustees, giving her influence over the institution’s  . Had the plan reduced its options to those on the menu it adopted last year, “participants would have saved over $8 million in fees in 2014 alone, and many millions more since 2010,” according to the complaint, filed in Federal District Court in Massachusetts. M. I. T. recognized that the plan structure was inefficient, the filing said, since that was part of the reason it said it made the changes. But even after the overhaul, the suit alleges, investment costs could be further reduced. Fidelity, which noted that it was not a defendant in the case, declined to comment. Mr. Schlichter’s firm has settled about half of his 20 cases over the last 10 years. His first case involving a 403( b) was against Novant Health, a nonprofit hospital system, which settled last year for $32 million. In a landmark case he argued last year before the Supreme Court, the justices, in a unanimous decision, agreed that plan sponsors had a “continuing duty to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones. ” A series of suits, from Mr. Schlichter’s firm and others, continue to be filed in the corporate world: Several asset managers, including Neuberger Berman and Franklin Resources, among others, have recently been sued for putting their own investments in their employees’ 401( k) plans. Some of the more prominent cases against 401( k) plans settled by Mr. Schlichter include a $62 million settlement against Lockheed Martin, $57 million from Boeing and $27. 5 million from Ameriprise, all in 2015. He also settled cases with Cigna, International Paper, Caterpillar, General Dynamics, Bechtel and Kraft. Mr. Schlichter said his firm, which works on a contingency basis, typically collects up to a third of the settlement, while the remainder goes to the plaintiffs and members of the class. He said that his settlements also required employers to make changes to their plans to ensure fees were reasonable in the future.",0

70,American Drivers Regain Appetite for Gas Guzzlers - The New York Times,Matt Richtel,"The single most effective action that most Americans can take to help reduce the dangerous emissions that cause climate change? Buy a more   car. But consumers are heading in the opposite direction. They have rekindled their love of bigger cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, favoring them over small cars, hybrids and electric vehicles, which are considered crucial to helping slow global warming. So far this year, nearly 75 percent of the people who have traded in a hybrid or electric car to a dealer have replaced it with an   car, an 18 percent jump from 2015, according to Edmunds. com, a car shopping and research site. In 2008, President Obama set a goal of a million electric cars on the road by 2015 in the United States, but the total is now around 442, 000, including   hybrids. This year, electric and hybrid sales have dropped to 2. 4 percent of   purchases. Falling gas prices have made big, heavy cars fashionable again, said Michael Sivak, the director of sustainable worldwide transportation at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. In fact, demand for trucks, S. U. V.s and vans has rebounded to historic levels after they dropped sharply in 2008, when gas was $4 a gallon. “People have very short memories about the price of gasoline,” Dr. Sivak said. That spells trouble for the environment.     vehicles, including S. U. V.s and pickups as well as cars, account for 16. 2 percent of all greenhouse emissions produced in the United States, Dr. Sivak’s research shows, making them the biggest source of emissions that individuals control. Reducing tailpipe emissions “is perhaps the most important thing Americans can do,” said Andrew Jones, a   of Climate Interactive, a think tank. “We’re doing the opposite. ” The changing consumer patterns are in plain view at swapalease. com, a marketplace for people who want to get out of a car lease by transferring it to someone else. Dozens of hybrids and electric vehicles are available, in some cases languishing without bites from buyers. “Nobody is interested,” said Angelo Di Maria, who lives in the Bronx. Several weeks ago, he listed his   ’s 2013 Toyota Prius. To spur interest, he added a $1, 500 cash incentive, which sharply cut the monthly lease payment to $283 from $391. Still no buyer. Mr. Di Maria said that his    who works in construction, loved the Prius, but that his company had given him a Ford   pickup. “Who doesn’t want to drive around in a big tank?” Mr. Di Maria said. “When people start to think gas is more affordable, do they really want to pay the premium on the hybrid?” Buyers of electric cars enjoy huge discounts, however, including federal and state rebates, and the opportunity to bypass gas stations altogether. For that reason, Felix Sui, who works in technology in San Diego, loved his BMW electric car. But now that he and his wife are starting a family, he sold the lease on it so he could buy a Volvo S. U. V. “The XC90,” he clarified. “The big one. ” A preference for big cars is not going to help the country meet the goals outlined in the Paris climate accord, reached in December. To help reach those goals, average fuel economy would need to soar to at least 100 miles per gallon  —   most likely achievable only through widespread adoption of electric and other   cars, according to Ben Haley, a   of Evolved Energy Research, a consulting firm. President Obama has pushed for stronger federal   rules that call for cars to average 40 miles per gallon by 2025, according to the Environmental Protection Agency the current average is 25. 4 miles per gallon. Though electric cars may be somewhat out of favor for now, that may change. Many are hoping that the Tesla could transform Americans’ views on electric cars, much the way the iPhone did with mobile technology. Tesla still carries asterisks  —   it is losing money, and it is not clear if the company can produce what it has promised  —   but it can point to 370, 000 votes of confidence. That is how many people have put down $1, 000 to reserve one of Tesla’s new Model 3 cars, a significantly   version of its luxury models they won’t even be out until late next year. There are hopes, too, for the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, which boasts a range of 200 miles, nearly matching the projected range of the Tesla Model 3. Those would more than double the range of many cars on the market, helping alleviate the “range anxiety” that many consumers feel. When Tesla first let people sign up online in March, and reservations surged to 325, 000 within a week, Dr. John Sterman, a climate expert at M. I. T. was heartened by the prospect of broader interest in   cars. “All my friends and colleagues were sending me links to the media reports,” he said. “ I thought, this is great news. ” Years from now, he added, “we will look at this as a watershed moment. ” Others who worry about climate change can sound like boosters for the new car. “Tesla is notorious for performance. It can outperform the hottest, most conventional car,” said Albert Ayala, deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, a publicagency that governs air quality. When he gives speeches and is asked how the   market can improve, he points to Tesla and says, “That’s exactly what we’re trying to do. ” Seconds after preorders for the new Model 3 became available, John Meyer, 21, an entrepreneur in New York, made his reservation. At the time, he was on a flight from Newark to Los Angeles, and worried that he would miss out if the plane’s   went down. He called the car a “game changer” because it has everything he wants  —   it is cool, beautiful and powerful, he said, as well as being environmentally friendly. “I could’ve bought a Prius before,” he said. “And I would have if it looked like an Audi. ”",0
71,"Hillary Clinton Builds $150 Million War Chest, Doubling Donald Trump - The New York Times",Nicholas Confessore and Rachel Shorey,"Donald J. Trump entered the homestretch of the campaign at a pronounced financial disadvantage to Hillary Clinton, according to figures Mr. Trump’s team released on Saturday, and far below the   goal he set for himself earlier in the race. After raising $100 million in partnership with Republican Party organizations in September, Mr. Trump and committees linked to his campaign began October with $75 million in cash on hand. Mrs. Clinton raised $154 million in September and began October with roughly $150 million in the bank, her campaign said, twice as much as Mr. Trump. Many of the Republican Party’s leading contributors have stayed away from his campaign, judging from financial disclosures filed by Mr. Trump and his party on Saturday, signaling his difficulties in persuading party elites to back him. One exception was Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor who spoke in support of Mr. Trump at the Republican convention in July. A person close to Mr. Thiel said on Saturday that the investor was putting $1. 25 million behind Mr. Trump’s campaign. Still, Mrs. Clinton will have a huge war chest for   advertising and organizing at a time when she has regained her lead in public opinion polls and Mr. Trump is openly feuding with his party and mired in accusations that he groped women. The monthly figure was a record for Mr. Trump and provided evidence of his powerful appeal among   donors: The campaign now estimates that 2. 6 million people have given to his campaign. But it was only a small improvement over his   in July and August, suggesting he might have peaked. Moreover, Mr. Trump has so far not followed through on promises to spend $100 million of his own fortune on the campaign. In September, he contributed $2 million, his usual amount since he became the Republican nominee, leaving him roughly $44 million short of his goal. Mr. Trump also said he would blitz Mrs. Clinton with $100 million in advertising, but he has spent about $32 million, according to two Republican media buyers, although they have reserved substantial additional advertising in swing states. “Our ad spending strategy has not changed,” Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, wrote in an email. “Mr. Trump continues to make significant contributions to his campaign. ” Mr. Trump is not starved for cash and could still make additional investments in television and turnout to increase his chances on Nov. 8. But his campaign has been marred by disagreements with Republican organizations in some key states. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s campaign cut ties with Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, a pivotal swing state. A Trump aide accused Mr. Borges of publicly undermining Mr. Trump to promote his own ambitions to run for chairman of the Republican National Committee. In a letter to other Ohio Republicans, the aide, Robert Paduchik, said Mr. Borges had spent the past week on a “  media tour with state and national outlets to criticize our party’s nominee. ” Still, Mr. Paduchik added that he expected the Ohio Republican Party to keep covering payroll costs that it had been paying on behalf of Mr. Trump’s campaign. Some leading Republican donors have tried an awkward straddle, providing money to a “super PAC” that is focused on attacking Mrs. Clinton but is said to be aiming its fire to achieve maximum benefit for Republican House and Senate candidates endangered by Mr. Trump’s slide. That group, called Future45, received $5 million from the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson in September and the same amount from his wife, Miriam. An additional $2. 3 million came from Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder, and other donors, including the coal magnate Joe Craft. But disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday hinted at fragmentation and disarray among outside groups that support Mr. Trump and have competed with one another for dollars and turf. While Mr. Trump’s sons and advisers have appeared at   for two groups  —   Great America PAC and Rebuilding America Now  —   at least three additional super PACs have organized in apparent support of him. One, called Save America From Its Government, was founded by Andrew Beal, a banker and real estate investor who is a member of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory team. According to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Beal gave $2 million to the group in September, nearly all of the money it reported raising. A fourth group, a committee called American Horizons, was attacked by the Trump campaign this summer for promoting a “Dinner With Donald” contest that Mr. Trump had neither authorized nor agreed to. The complaints do not appear to have affected  : American Horizons raised $750, 000 from July to September, a third of it from donors giving hundreds of dollars each. The committee has spent just $12, 000 on expenditures backing Mr. Trump. But the biggest chunk of spending, about $400, 000, went to fees to a consulting firm owned by the PAC’s treasurer.",0
72,"Trump Catches What Sick Reporter Snuck In Interview, Has Priceless Response",Amanda Shea,"Trump Catches What Sick Reporter Snuck In Interview, Has Priceless Response Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This CNN’s Dana Bash (left), Bash Interviewing Donald Trump (right) 
Donald Trump stopped campaigning for just an hour-and-half to work in a brief appearance at the opening of his new hotel, whereÂ reporters awaited his arrival â one of which had a nasty surprise hidden up her sleeve. When the Republican candidate caught it mid-interview on live television, he had a priceless response that the CNN crank won’t soon forget. 
Liberal news host Dana Bash is evidently no fan of Donald Trump, which she’s not afraid to show in her biased reporting. Her arrogance backfired when she was in front of him at the grand opening of his hotel, thinking she could get away with a public attempt to insult him, but she got rightfully put in her place by the blunt candidate. 
Trump’s schedule is jam packed with as many campaign stops as he can cram into these final weeks of the election, taking advantage of every waking moment to earn Americans’ votes. Somehow in the middle of his traveling to every corner of the country, he managed to squeeze in a stop at his hotel’s grand opening where he created countless jobs and a structure he should be proud of. However, Bash didn’t see it this way in her attempt to slam him for this 90-minute “time off” he was taking from campaigning. 
During her live interview at the opening, the nasty CNN reporter had the audacity to sneak in this question: “For people who say youâre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?” She painted this pit stop as an irresponsible thing to do while Hillary Clinton is working hard.

Trump wasn’t going to allow her to get away with asking such a disgusting thing, given the vast difference in effort between him and his opponent and didn’t mince a single word in his priceless answer. 
“I say the following. You have been covering me for the last, long time. I did yesterday 8 stops and 3 major speeches. And Iâve been doing this for weeks straight. I left for here for an hour-and-a-half. Iâm leaving here and going to North Carolina, then Iâm going to Florida, then Iâm going up to New Hampshire. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. And yet you ask me that question. I think itâs a very rude question .” 
Bash didn’t see that coming, and Trump proved once again why America needs an unapologetic leader like him. He tells it how it is and backs up what he says with real action, unlike his competition who puts in a couple of days of campaigning and calls it good since it’s all for show anyway. 
Trump is putting in ten times the effort with genuine work ethic on his own dime to honestly earn the votes, and if he wants to take a couple of minutes to make an appearance at an opening, he’s more than entitled to do it. It pales in comparison to the weeks Hillary has had off relaxing and recovering. Trump’s creating jobs as he’s campaigning, but Hillary’s just napping.",1
73,All 100 Senators Contacted Russian Government This Week,Joel B. Pollak,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions found himself at the center of controversy this week because he answered a question about the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russian government without talking about his contacts as a United States Senator. [The assumption made by the media, the Democrats, and even some Republicans was that even routine contact with the Russian government is burdened by suspicion of collusion. Not since the McCarthy era have suspicions reached such levels.  But if Sessions ought to resign, perhaps the entire Senate should quit. Because on Monday  —   two days before the Washington Post broke the highly scandalous story that Sessions had met the Russian ambassador twice in the course of his duties  —   every single United States Senator had formal contact with the Russian government. And not just any functionary: they had contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. Worse (apparently) still, they initiated the contact with the Russians. The contact was a letter, signed by the entire Senate, urging Putin to release a valuable library of Jewish religious texts that was seized by earlier Russian regimes and which has been the subject of a legal and diplomatic dispute in recent decades. Senate Letter Re Chabad  —   2017  —   Without Hatch Signature by Breitbart News on Scribd,  Senator Orrin Hatch ( ) provided the final signature on the letter, and tweeted proudly about his support for the effort: For the last year, Hatch has led his colleagues in an effort to recover the texts, including a letter signed by all 100 Senators.

74,10 Images That Perfectly Illustrate the Struggle Against the Dakota Access Pipeline,The Anti-Media,"
By Nick Bernabe
The struggle to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline has been mired in police brutality and militarization. In fact, many have likened the atmosphere in Standing Rock, North Dakota, to a war zone.
The corporate media initially refused to cover the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, though the ongoing story’s virality on social media eventually forced it into the mainstream. Even now that the #NoDAPL movement has developed into a national political narrative, the media continues to whitewash the severity of the crackdown against the Native American protesters, who call themselves “water protectors.”
Below are 10 images I have come across (while closely following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests for Anti-Media ) that narrate the struggle at Standing Rock:

75,"Washington State Takes 10 Refugees, 0 Muslim Rest of Country Takes 189 Refugees, 151 Muslim - Breitbart",Michael Patrick Leahy,"On Tuesday, the second full weekday after Federal Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order halting President Trump’s executive order that temporarily blocked the issuance of visas for seven Middle Eastern countries and temporarily banned refugees from all countries, ten refugees arrived in the state of Washington. [None of them were Muslim. All ten were from the Ukraine, and were either Baptist, Evangelical Christian, Uniate (a branch of Christian denomination found in eastern Europe) or Pentecostalist, according to the Department of State’s interactive website.  Across the rest of the country, it was a different story. More than 75 percent of the 189 refugees who arrived in other parts of the United States on Tuesday, 151 in total, were Muslim, according to the Department of State’s interactive website. It was the ultimate irony, since Judge Robart based his decision on an argument from Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson that Trump’s executive order was unconstitutional because it was motivated by a desire to ban Muslims. “Prior to his election, Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would ban Muslims from entering the United States,” Ferguson alleged in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by the state of Washington with the United States District Court Western District of Washington on January 30, 2017: On December 7, 2015, candidate Trump issued a press release calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. ” As of the date of this filing, the press release remains available on Trump’s campaign website and is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. In defending his decision shortly thereafter, candidate Trump compared the Muslim ban to former President Franklin Roosevelt’s decision to intern Japanese Americans during World War II, and stated, “This is a president highly respected by all, [Roosevelt] did the same thing. ” A media report of this interview is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. On June 14, 2016, candidate Trump reiterated his promise to ban all Muslims entering this country until “we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screenthose people coming into our country. ” “Section 3 of the Executive Order, if implemented, will result in substantial burdens on the exercise of religion by   immigrants by, for example, preventing them from exercising their religion while in detention, returning to their religious communities in Washington,   taking upcoming, planned religious travel abroad. Such burdens on religion violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,” Ferguson argued in the January 30 complaint. In response to the Department of Justice’s appeal of Judge Robart’s decision to the 9th Federal Circuit Court, Ferguson restated that claim. “Here, the State [of Washington] has plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity that the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims,” Ferguson argued  in States’ Response to Emergency Motion Under Circuit Rule   for Administrative Stay and Motion for Stay Pending Appeal filed with the 9th Federal Circuit Court on February 6, continuing with that theme. In the week between President Trump’s signing of the executive order on January 27 and Judge Robart’s issuance of the temporary restraining order halting it nationwide on February 3, the Trump administration granted waivers allowing 842 refugees to enter the country. One hundred and   of those refugees, or 15 percent, were Muslim, according to the State Department’s interactive website.",0

77,"NCAA, Big 12 Keeps Watchful Eye on Texas Bathroom Bill - Breitbart",Warner Todd Huston,"Texas is one of a list of states looking to institute their own transgender bathroom restrictions, quite regardless of the guff North Carolina took for its own bill last year. Predictably, just as it did against North Carolina, the NCAA and the Big 12 Conference look to act against Texas over the law. [After North Carolina passed its 2016 House Bill 2, which restricted some bathrooms, the NCAA decided to pull all tournament games from the state in protest over what the organization labeled “discrimination. ”  At the time, the AP wrote that the state’s governor criticized the NCAA for the move. “Gov. Pat McCrory says the NCAA failed to show North Carolina respect when it moved championships and tournament games out of the state because of a law that governs which bathrooms transgender people must use,” the AP said. Now that Texas walks down the same legislative path that North Carolina blazed, the NCAA and Big 12 again look to punish a state. Announcing the effort in Texas, Lone Star State Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said of the new bill, “This issue is not about discrimination  —   it’s about public safety, protecting businesses and common sense,” according to USA Today. Since the announcement in Texas, the NCAA has put the state on notice that they are watching. While the NCAA itself didn’t have a statement at this time, the Big 12 did have something to say. “The Big 12 Conference is aware of the filing of Senate Bill 6 in the Texas State legislature,” said Big 12 spokesman Bob Burda. “We will track the bill’s progress through the legislature, and at an appropriate time discuss its impact with our member institutions. ” The NCAA acted quickly and with prejudice against North Carolina, but it’s unclear whether it will act in a similar, swift manner against Texas. With at least five other states across the country contemplating similar bills, it may come to diminishing returns for the leagues to act in boycott. The boycott of one state came easy for them, but if five or more pass bathroom laws similar to North Carolina’s the leagues may end up on the outside looking in. Along with Texas, other states now beginning the process of debating and enacting a bathroom bill include Alabama, Missouri, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington.

78,"Massive ESPN Financial, Subscriber Losses Drag Down Disney’s First-Quarter Sales - Breitbart",Dylan Gwinn,"A year that saw arguably the five greatest championship game performances of all time should have helped right the ship for ESPN, and at the very least stopped the trend of massive subscriber losses which have plagued the   sports giant for the last few years. [Well, that did not happen, and ESPN appears to be a sinking ship, dragging parent company Disney down with it.  Bloomberg reports that ESPN badly hurt Disney’s first quarter sales, falling well short of projections. According to The Wrap, “Cable networks, particularly ESPN, have been an albatross on Disney’s stock price even as the company’s two other major prongs, movies and theme parks, continue to perform well. As cheaper TV alternatives began to proliferate, ESPN hemorrhaged subscribers during the course of 2016 and is now at less than 88 million, compared with a peak of 100. 1 million in 2011. At an estimated $7 per subscriber, that dip has been a substantial hit to Disney, especially considering media networks made up 49 percent of Disney’s profits during fiscal 2016. ” In other words, everyone else at Disney met or exceeded their projected goals, except for ESPN who lost more than twelve million subscribers in just under six years. But, the problem for ESPN goes deeper than just losing subscribers and money. The Wrap explains, “At the same time, rights fees for the live sports ESPN specializes in broadcasting continue to go up, as there’s plenty of competition for one of the few pieces of programmed television that still delivers monster ratings. ESPN will pay $7. 3 billion for content this year  —   the biggest price tag among all media companies. Operating income at Disney’s cable networks division  —   primarily ESPN  —   plunged 11 percent compared with the same time the previous year. Disney attributed that drop entirely to lower ESPN revenue. ” Less cash on hand means less cash to purchase rights to sporting events, which can prove particularly harmful to an entity that considers itself a sports network. Now, Disney and ESPN have laid much of the blame for their subscriber loss at the feet of the cord cutting phenomenon that has impacted all cable providers to some degree. That’s a fair point, but ESPN’s losses have far exceeded the pace and rate of losses among other providers. ESPN will also cite the fact that they’re rolling out more   streaming content that will offset much of the losses they’ve taken on the cable side. Great, but what will ESPN show on those streaming channels? Will they show the   equivalent of Jason Bateman’s ESPN “The Ocho?” I enjoy a good game of dodgeball as much as the next guy, but unless ESPN plans on exclusively featuring the NFL, or   NBA games on their streaming networks, virtually no one will watch. Not to mention, it’s highly unlikely that either the NBA or the NFL would enter into a contract with ESPN which allowed them to only offer their games via stream. So, what can ESPN do? In November, ESPN ombudsman Jim Brady wrote that he felt the network had become too liberal, turning off half the country and potentially effecting viewership and subscribership. Sadly, three months after that rare and blinding light of truth and honesty there’s no reason to believe anything has changed regarding the politics of ESPN. Not when you have hosts like ESPN’s Ryen Rusillo stating, on the air, that he no longer knows what his job is, since everyone around him just wants to bash Trump and talk liberal politics, instead of talking about sports. Maybe, if ESPN focused more on sports instead of alienating half the country, their business wouldn’t be circling the drain right now. After all, Lady Gaga just did a halftime show in which she decided to not enrage half the country, and got rewarded with an enormous surge in digital music sales. Imagine that. Don’t insult the country and they’ll consume your product. Who would have thought? Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
79,"Megyn Kelly, Contract Set to Expire Next Year, Is Primed for the Big Show - The New York Times",John Koblin,"Barbara Walters is retired, Oprah Winfrey is running a network and Megyn Kelly sees an opening. “It’s there for the taking right now,” she said in a recent interview. And what is there for the taking? What those famous hosts had accomplished: conducting the sort of interviews that could transfix a nation. “Those were the biggest spots to go for an interview if you had something you wanted to get off your chest, if you were in the middle of a scandal or a major news story and you wanted to do a     to get past it or to go on the record,” she said. She quickly added: “And I’m here!” Making the Oprah or Barbara Walters leap is a remarkably tricky business. Many have tried before, with daytime shows or   specials, only to run into a wall and return to a more comfortable corner of television. And the interview special is a relic from a time on television when what was broadcast on the Big Four networks was what mattered most. But on Tuesday, Ms. Kelly, the Fox News anchor and host of “The Kelly File,” will take her first crack at a   special on Fox  —   the broadcast network, not the cable news station  —   with “Megyn Kelly Presents. ” There is certainly one big hook to draw viewers: She will confront the likely Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, a man who over the last nine months has kept Ms. Kelly in the middle of a running news story by relentlessly attacking her. And though Mr. Trump represents the   get, she will also interview two actors (Michael Douglas and Laverne Cox) and a lawyer (Robert Shapiro) who is back in the news after the successful O. J. Simpson anthology “American Crime Story” on FX. Mr. Trump aside, it is with those interviews that Ms. Kelly hopes to accomplish something new: prove that she can do much more than simply host a nightly news show. If all goes well, she will display range and versatility at a convenient time. Her contract with Fox News is set to expire in a little more than a year. “I would like to prove to myself that I have these other muscles,” she said, as she sat in her cramped office on Sixth Avenue. “It doesn’t all have to be   level of difficulty. It can be other kinds of questioning where you get more to somebody’s humanity and tell their story. ” She said that one of her benchmarks for success was if viewers said: “I saw Megyn in a new light. ” Her Fox News show, “The Kelly File,” has been a hit for more than two years, but Ms. Kelly, who is 45, is in the middle of a big moment in her career. Since Mr. Trump began attacking her after the first Republican debate in August, Ms. Kelly has approached something close to genuine celebrity status. She was on the cover of Vanity Fair in February, she has made the rounds of the   circuit over the last three months. She also made her first appearance at the Met Gala in early May, the lavish Manhattan event that effectively serves as the year’s social register for the rich and famous. There is also a book in the works  —   she is handing in the manuscript to her editor at HarperCollins later this month and spent the last week writing the Trump section. It comes out the week after Election Day in November, and Tuesday will bring her the first   special. There are real questions whether the   “special” can attract a meaningful audience and lift a career. Long gone are the days when Ms. Walters could attract an audience of about 50 million people, as her exclusive interview with Monica Lewinsky did in 1999. But even in a fragmented TV landscape, they can occasionally break through. Last year, Caitlyn Jenner’s revelation that she was transgender in an interview with Diane Sawyer drew nearly 17 million viewers, which qualifies as a huge hit these days. Ms. Kelly was reluctant to discuss a ratings goal. The producer for “Megyn Kelly Presents,” the veteran TV newsman Bill Geddie, pointed out that Fox did not ordinarily run these type of news specials and that expectations should be managed accordingly. “Megyn said it right: We’re looking for a single here,” he said. The special can accomplish other goals for her instead. The news cycle has been relentlessly focused on politics and Ms. Kelly said she was more than happy to take a break from that. She is not a political junkie. “That’s not all I am,” she said “I love covering the news, but I’m not a political person, so I don’t know that I get the jones out of immersing myself in politics all day, every day the way some others do. ” She added, “You look out at the news landscape, and there isn’t the one perfect job that would service the soul. ” If that turn of phrase makes her sound a little like Oprah, it is probably not by accident. She pointed to Ms. Winfrey and Charlie Rose to illustrate her broader goals. “Oprah’s a bit more spiritual and helps improve people’s lives, which I also would like to do,” she said. “Charlie has a thing that I don’t have. He will sit down with Brian Dennehy, who’s got an amazing show on Broadway, and talk to him about it. He’ll sit down with business executives like Tim Cook and talk to him about what’s happening in his life. ” And if Ms. Kelly wants to be part Oprah, part Charlie Rose and also fill the Barbara Walters vacuum (“Who in their right mind would reject that?” she said of Ms. Walters) she got the right producer. Mr. Geddie produced more than 100 of Ms. Walters’s   specials. “Megyn Kelly Presents” will be quite a departure from her regular   show: Say goodbye to the talking heads and   cuts, and cue a gauzier look, with two comfortable chairs and a contemplative head nod. “It’s nice to step outside of it every once in a while and try out the Louis Vuitton luggage,” she said. This is, of course, leads to the   question: What will happen when her contract expires next year? Whether or not the special is a success, she will have plenty of suitors lined up. And Fox News is keen to keep her. The special was the brainchild of the Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes, Ms. Kelly said. And she expressed loyalty to Mr. Ailes when asked about her future. “The number of times he’s had my back, given me opportunities, stuck his own neck out there to protect me, I feel very grateful to him. ” She continued: “Having said that, this is a fickle business, and you never say never. Every time I’ve been up for a contract negotiation I’ve been   to what possibilities exist. ” Though the special may show how adept she is at interviewing a celebrity, much of the attention on Tuesday night will ultimately be on Mr. Trump, who made her his No. 1 media nemesis with his famous description of “blood coming out of her   …     wherever. ” Ms. Kelly said she planned to contact him for months but the attacks on her kept coming (Mr. Trump tweeted regularly about her, calling her “Crazy Megyn,” and he skipped the second Fox News debate in late January because of Ms. Kelly’s involvement). She wanted him for this special, but it was not an easy assignment. Even Mr. Geddie, who has known Mr. Trump for 20 years, reached out and was given a flat no. It was not until April that Ms. Kelly reached out to Mr. Trump for the first time since the debate in August. She later met him alone at the Trump Tower to discuss the interview. Less than two weeks later, he was in. Though she concedes that Mr. Trump has made her “name better known,” she also refers to the last year as a dark one. There have been security concerns, and the stream of tweets from Mr. Trump and his supporters has been unpleasant. “This is one of the things that I get into with Trump in the interview,” she said. “Not about me but about whether he realizes the power his words have on the lives of his targets. Not just Megyn Kelly. ” In a campaign cycle in which the news media has been roundly criticized for kowtowing to Mr. Trump, Ms. Kelly has mostly been above it all. She even said on a March show: “I’m the    show in all of cable news and I haven’t had Trump on in seven months. It can be done without him too. ” With the apparent rapprochement, is Ms. Kelly worried about the perception that she, too, is doing whatever needs to be done to get him for an interview? “Listen, if I weren’t a journalist, would I have called up Trump and said ‘Let’s meet’? No, I would not,” she said. “But it’s because I’m a journalist he was attacking me to begin with. So, no, you cannot compare me trying to put an end to his   barrage so that I can cover him like a normal journalist with the    obsessive coverage we have seen of his candidacy. ” Ms. Kelly expressed some frustration that she had been in the news for so long. Asked whether she thought Mr. Trump’s attacks would end after the special was broadcast, she took a long pause, and said, without a great deal of confidence: “I hope so. One never knows. ”",0
80,Teacher Suspended for Allowing Students to Hit Trump Pinata for Cinco de Mayo,Katherine Rodriguez,"A high school Spanish teacher from Colorado has been suspended after she reportedly made a piñata with President Trump’s face on it and allowed her students to hit it. [Johnstown Milliken School District Superintendent Martin Foster said the incident took place at Roosevelt High School in Johnstown during the Spanish class’s celebration of Cinco de Mayo, CBS Denver reported.  “This was an incredibly disrespectful act that does not reflect the values of Roosevelt High School or the school district,” Foster said in a statement. The teacher’s name has not yet been released. Photos and video of the incident circulated on Facebook and Snapchat, offending many parents. “He’s been defeated,” read one caption of a Snapchat photo showing two students holding up the   piñata with Trump’s face on it. One parent, Lesley Hollywood, posted the Snapchats to Facebook and shared her displeasure with the incident: “It is disturbing that this would be happening in a school setting,” Hollywood told CBS Denver. “Why divide people? Why do this? There are so many other ways we can address politics in schools. ” Hollywood said that according to some of the students, the piñata also featured an image of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. “I wouldn’t of cared if it was Obama’s face on that piñata, or if it had been Hillary Clinton’s face,” Hollywood added. “It doesn’t matter. This is not how we should be teaching our children politics in this country. ” KDVR reported that the district will launch an investigation starting Monday.",0

82,Snap Shares Leap 44% in Debut as Investors Doubt Value Will Vanish - The New York Times,Michael J. de la Merced,"Snapchat is a business built in large part on disappearing messages and adding animated dog ears and flower crowns to users’ selfies. As of Thursday, that business is worth about $34 billion  —   more than the market value of the   media company CBS, and about three times the size of another social media company, Twitter. Snapchat has made paper billionaires of its   founders five times over. In making its stock market debut in spectacular fashion  —   its shares rising 44 percent on their first day of trading  —   Snapchat’s parent, Snap Inc. has blazed a trail for other technology darlings like Uber and Spotify that remain privately held. It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months. The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its   user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchat’s founders control for decades to come. Then there are the shadows of onetime tech highfliers that have since crashed to earth. Twitter was valued at nearly $32 billion at the end of its first day of trading Wall Street now values it at roughly $11 billion and has called for the company to sell itself. An earlier force in social media, Myspace, sold itself to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation for $580 million in 2005 six years later, it was sold to Justin Timberlake and other investors for $35 million. Some analysts have already shown skepticism about the newest publicly traded tech giant. One, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, says the share price should be $10, far below the company’s offering price of $17, which itself was above the initial range predicted. Snap faces competition from larger companies and the challenge of a   user base, he said. Boosters of Snap’s prospects argue instead that Snap has the potential to become less like Twitter and more like its biggest rival, the $395 billion Facebook. These supporters point to some of the company’s obvious strengths: the 158 million people on average who used Snapchat each day by the end of 2016 the roughly 18 times a day that those users opened the app on average the $404 million in sales that it collected last year, up from nothing three years ago. For now, investors appeared to focus on the positive. Snap raised $3. 4 billion in its market debut, the most by an American tech company since Facebook’s initial offering in 2012, according to data from Renaissance Capital. It was the first significant tech stock sale since at least December. And the 44 percent pop in its stock price was the biggest enjoyed by a company of a   I. P. O. since Twitter’s debut in 2013. More than 217 million shares traded on Thursday, as some investors bought and others cashed in, exceeding the number of shares Snap sold in the I. P. O. For investors in other   unicorns  —   a term for   valued at more than $1 billion  —   the immense success of Snap’s deal highlights the appetite for a tech darling, even if the company still bleeds money. Count Uber, Spotify and Airbnb within that group. “The sound you’re hearing today after the Snap I. P. O. is the happy snapping of fingers of   unicorns and their investors,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. “It looks like Snap has set the path to monetization. ” In countless meetings during a   roadshow with investors, Snap executives sought to rebut some of the biggest concerns about the company’s prospects. Slowing growth toward the end of last year stemmed from problems with the service’s Android app. Competition from Facebook, which openly copied some of Snapchat’s signature features at Instagram, would do little to dent user enthusiasm. And the company would continue to press innovations, such as the branded lens filters that transform users into monsters, fairies or Taco Bell tacos, and that have become new forms of advertising beloved by brands. Potential new ideas include drones and   cameras. By Wednesday night, Snap’s bankers had drawn up their list of the investors who would get the first shares, largely big mutual funds and some hedge funds, all with the aim of picking firms that are most likely to stick around for the long term. The I. P. O. minted wealth for others that invested when it was a younger company, including big venture capital firms like Benchmark Capital and a high school in the Bay Area. Unlike newly public companies that seek to celebrate their first day of trading on the stock markets, Snap kept its festivities largely confined to the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s top executives and board members gathered there for a   breakfast, where guests were presented with pins in the shape of Snapchat’s ghost mascot. Evan Spiegel, 26, and Bobby Murphy, 28, Snap’s founders, briefly addressed the crowd, uncharacteristically clad in suits and ties rather than their customary  . They also presented exchange officials with their version of the customary gift given by market debutants: one of the vending machines that sell the company’s Spectacles,   sunglasses that send   videos to the app. (The machine won’t be refilled once it sells out of Spectacles.) Then the founders walked through the floor of an exchange bedecked in the company’s signature yellow  —   the color splayed on electronic boards, wrapped around water bottles and leaping off some executives’ ties. One Snap employee had ducked into the Hermès store down the street to pick up a yellow tie days before just for the occasion. Mr. Spiegel’s fiancée, the supermodel Miranda Kerr, enthusiastically documented the day on her own Snapchat Story and posed for selfies. Attendees on the floor could unlock a special filter that placed the company’s ghost mascot in their videos, holding virtual Snapchat balloons and ejecting a rainbow from its mouth. At 9:30 a. m. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy rang the Big Board’s opening bell and then briefly basked in the adulation. Snap’s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, escorted his family around the exchange and posed for pictures with fellow employees. But by the time Snap’s shares opened for trading at $24 each  —   which was later in the morning  —   the company’s top executives had disappeared from the floor, heading to the nearby offices of one of the banks involved in the public offering, Goldman Sachs, to watch the opening. Then many staff members trekked to Snap’s Midtown Manhattan offices to head back to work.",0
83,Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary’s Benghazi Hearing,admin,"Zero Hedge October 26, 2016 
In the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. 
Peter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta’s home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadzik’s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
As the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement “is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices.” As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign’s “cozy relationship” with the Obama Justice Department. 
The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik’s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
“The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
“ It’s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton ,” he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. 
Kadzik’s role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
A Long, Friendly History 
Podesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “ kept me out of jail.” 
As the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. “He did lie to me,” Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton’s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that “Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.” 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich’s pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
Kadzik’s current role 
In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . 
In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained “that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.” 
DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch’s appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama’s political appointees — a list which includes Kadzik — “are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. ” 
It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis’ questions. 
Kadzik’s first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. 
Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI’s files of the Clinton email investigation. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 9:52 am Share this article",1
84,"TV Series About ’First Female MLB Pitcher’ Canned After One, Low-Rated Season - Breitbart",Warner Todd Huston,"After a stunted   order, the Fox baseball series “Pitch” has officially struck out. [The TV series telling the story of the fictional “first female pitcher in Major League Baseball” has been canceled after a single, shortened and   season, Fox has announced.  Executive producer Kevin Falls revealed the network’s decision on his Twitter feed, thanking the “faithful fans” for “trying so hard” to save the show. I’m sorry to tell you that @PITCHonFOX will not be getting a second season. #Pitch,  —   Kevin Falls (@KevinFalls) May 2, 2017,  Falls heads up Left Coast Productions, and if “Pitch” was any indication, then the “left” part of that moniker is fitting. Within the first two minutes of the opening scene of the first episode, “Pitch” worked in both gay activist and TV host Ellen DeGeneres and former Secretary of State and failed Democrat candidate for president, Hillary Clinton. The first few episodes of the short order, single season also featured Fox Sports 1’s Katie Nolan, who portrayed herself as a TV sports analyst, the same Katie Nolan who took to Twitter to call popular Fox News personality Sean Hannity a “literal fu**ing moron. ” Some say that Fox hurt the series when it rushed the show to air months earlier than its original Spring of 2017 launch date. The network jumped the show into rotation, though, after ABC moved “Scandal” to accommodate star Kerry Washington’s pregnancy. Fox thought it could capitalize on audiences looking for a series starring a strong female lead, but audiences didn’t comply with the network’s hopes.

85,"Seeking Best Fit, Women’s Final Four Returns to Friday-Sunday - The New York Times",Jeré Longman,"DALLAS  —   The women’s Final Four is a showcase in search of a proper audience. In recent years, the N. C. A. A. has explored various options for rejuvenating its most popular women’s sporting event, seeking to counter indifferent attendance at this marquee championship. A study in 2013 offered several bold ideas, like holding the Women’s Final Four at the same site as the men’s event, or even moving it to Europe, China, Russia or Qatar. Another, less radical, proposal was to return the Final Four to a   format, from  . The new schedule was adopted for this year, and so on Friday night, the national semifinals took place at American Airlines Center here, with South Carolina defeating Stanford,   in the first game before Mississippi State upset Connecticut,   in the second. Capacity crowds were expected for the two semifinals and the final, the N. C. A. A. said. With weekend games, fans do not have to miss a considerable part of the workweek to attend the Final Four, as they did when the championship game was played on a Tuesday night from 2003 to 2016. (The men’s Final Four continues to have a   format.) Also, some believed the women’s final had begun to feel anticlimactic when it was played a night after the men’s final. That seemed especially true last year, when Villanova defeated North Carolina on a   shot the day before UConn swamped Syracuse by 31 points. “The reason we moved to   was based on a lot of surveys and people saying, from a fan experience, that having to take that whole additional week off when we played on Tuesday was difficult,” said Rick Nixon, the N. C. A. A.’s associate director of championships and a spokesman for the organization. “To be in a   situation here in Dallas on Friday and Sunday, I think it’s worked out. ” In effect, the N. C. A. A. seems to have put a higher premium on a full arena than expanded television ratings. Friday’s semifinals were to be broadcast on ESPN2, competing with an N. B. A. doubleheader on ESPN featuring San   City and Golden  . Sunday’s championship game will not have its accustomed   slot on ESPN, either. Instead, it will start at 6 p. m. Eastern time, ahead of the network’s opening night coverage of Major League Baseball, featuring the World Series champion Chicago Cubs at rival St. Louis. “We’re anxious to see where the ratings play out,” Nixon said. “It might not be all bad. ” ESPN said it would have preferred to retain the   format. Kara Lawson, a commentator, told The Hartford Courant that the move to ESPN2 of Friday’s semifinals, usually broadcast on ESPN, was a “big bummer for exposure of the game. ” Carol Stiff, vice president for women’s sports programming at ESPN, was more sanguine. An arena at capacity is “good for the game,” she said, and in reference to the women’s final, she added, “I think we might pull in more numbers on a Sunday. ” The final will be promoted as part of a “Super Sunday,” Stiff said. “From the crowning of a champion to handing it over to the Cubs, it’s a pretty big day. ” Not everyone was pleased with the time slots for Friday’s semifinals. The tipoff for   Carolina was set for 7:30 p. m. while UConn was set to play Mississippi State at closer to 10 p. m. The Huskies draw the biggest ratings in women’s college basketball, but Coach Geno Auriemma said he was not happy that his team would have to wait around all day to play. “I’ve said this in the past  —   TV and what’s going on in the actual arena don’t go together,” he said on Thursday. He added: “We have to figure out how to work together, make it work for the   because we always use that term, you know. What’s best for the  ? Not playing at 10 at night. ” Another underlying issue in women’s college basketball is the debate about whether the dominance of UConn  —   with its   winning streak entering Friday, and its four consecutive national championships  —   is good or bad for the development of the sport. On the face of it, it might seem absurd to claim that sustained excellence was somehow detrimental. While the women’s regionals had their lowest average attendance in 20 years, according to The Associated Press, with an average of 4, 719 fans at each game, UConn sold out both the regional semifinal and the final in Bridgeport, Conn. drawing announced crowds of 8, 978. In February, when UConn won its 100th consecutive game, against South Carolina, it drew the highest television rating of the season, to that point, on ESPN2 for any college game, men’s or women’s. “I think they’re great for the game,” Stiff said of Auriemma and the Huskies. “Every time they’re on, people are tuning in. They want to know, what is special about this team? What’s in the sauce? Can he coach men? What’s the magic in the potion? This was supposed to be his down year. ”",0
86,A Proposal for a Canadian National Bird Ruffles Feathers - The New York Times,Ian Austen,"OTTAWA  —   With Canada’s 150th anniversary looming next year, a gap was noticed in the country’s roster of patriotic icons. It had a national anthem, a national tree, two national animals, two national sports  —   but no national bird. That would not do. The United States has the bald eagle, Mexico the golden eagle, France the rooster. Down in El Salvador they have the   motmot. But Canada, one of the world’s major bird habitats, had gone a century and a half without ever choosing an avian avatar. Why? The Department of Canadian Heritage, the official government keeper of symbols, could not explain it. Neither could ornithologists, nor the editor of Canadian Geographic magazine, Aaron Kylie. So the Royal Canadian Geographic Society, which publishes the magazine and perhaps saw a chance for some nice publicity, took up the   task of selecting one. And boy, did it ruffle feathers. To get the public involved, the society set up a website where Canadians could vote for their favorite bird  —   but it did not promise to heed the result. (Nobody wanted something like the “Boaty McBoatface” online   debacle.) Instead, a panel of experts was given the final say. Prominent Canadian writers championed their favorites in the magazine’s pages, and the contest became a popular topic on (of course) Twitter under the hashtag #CanadaBird. The society even staged a public debate in September, with naturalists and Canada’s poet laureate, George Elliott Clarke, each backing a species. And then came the big reveal. The proposed Canadian national bird would be   …     the gray jay. The what? It’s a fluffy songbird found in all 13 of Canada’s provinces and territories, which is a plus. But it tends to stick to the deep northern woods, and isn’t often seen as far south as the strip of land along the American border where most Canadians live. To them, the gray jay is a stranger. David Bird, a professor emeritus of wildlife biology and an ornithologist at McGill University in Montreal, was the bird’s booster in the debate. In an interview, Professor Bird gave a long list of reasons. For example, he said that instead of migrating, the gray jay stays in Canada and nests through the winter, feeding on frozen food that it stashed away in the fall under the loose bark of spruce trees. Mating pairs are monogamous, he said, unlike many other species. And gray jays like people when they meet them, alighting on their clothing or hands in the hope of a snack. “You’ve got loyal, you’ve got friendly, you’ve got smart, you’ve got hearty: That’s what Canadians think we are,” Professor Bird said. What you haven’t got is huge popularity. When about 50, 000 people voted in the magazine’s online poll, the gray jay finished third, behind the loon, which adorns Canada’s   coin, and the snowy owl. “I know a lot of Canadians didn’t know what the gray jay was, and were asking: ‘Do I see it in my feeder? ’” Professor Bird said. “And there are still people angry because they felt the popular vote was not honored. ” Mr. Kylie, the editor of Canadian Geographic, said that the loon and snowy owl were excluded from final consideration because they were already used as symbols by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. He said the relative unfamiliarity of the gray jay, also known as the whiskey jack, weighed on the plus side, not the minus. “We have an animal symbol, which is the beaver,” he said by way of analogy. “I would say that most Canadians don’t see a beaver in a given year. The fact that some Canadians don’t know this bird, I think, is all the more reason to have it proclaimed the national bird. ” Then you have the spelling of the bird’s names. Following the usual Canadian style, it ought to be called the grey jay, with an e, or the whisky jack, without one. The “gray” and “whiskey” spellings are seen (and resented) as Americanisms. The issue particularly vexes Dan Strickland, who began researching the bird as a graduate student at the Université de Montréal in late 1960s and continues to do so even after retiring as chief naturalist at Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario. The spellings, he said, come from the American Ornithologists’ Union, which took it upon itself to determine official names for all the birds in North America. The union gave the species the Latin name Perisoreus canadensis, and at first, from 1886 to 1910, referred to it in English as the Canada jay. The union dropped all English bird names in 1910, but brought them back later, and the current ones stem from a sweeping revision of its naming system in 1957. Mr. Strickland, whose license plate reads GRAY JAY, said that if the government did adopt the bird as a symbol, it ought to legislate a Canadian name for it. “The bird is obviously a viable, valid contender to be the national bird,” Mr. Strickland said. “But it is entirely inappropriate for the Canadian national bird to have a name imposed by a   foreign body. The A. O. U. can fall into line for once, or do whatever they want. But they do not get to name our national symbols. ” However you spell it, the magazine’s proposal has met with a cool reception from officialdom. “At this time, the government of Canada is not actively considering proposals to adopt a bird as a national symbol,”   Herbert, the press secretary for Mélanie Joly, the heritage minister, wrote in an email. Even so, Professor Bird is among those now pushing to get a gray jay bill through Parliament somehow. And he expressed relief that another bird associated with Canada was never a real contender. “Canada goose? Over my dead body,” he said. “They’re basically pooping machines, and they’re obnoxious. If we had picked that bird, we would be getting a lot more outrage than we have now. ”",0
87,Review: Beyoncé Makes ‘Lemonade’ Out of Marital Strife - The New York Times,Jon Pareles,"Marital strife smolders, explodes and uneasily subsides on “Lemonade” (Parkwood Entertainment) the album Beyoncé   on Saturday night. “You can taste the  ’s all over your breath” are the first words she sings in “Pray You Catch Me,” and that’s just the beginning of an album that probes betrayal, jealousy, revenge and rage before dutifully willing itself toward reconciliation at the end. Many of the accusations are aimed specifically and recognizably at her husband, Shawn Carter, the rapper Jay Z. “Tonight I regret the night I put that ring on,” she   in “Sorry,” a twitchy, flippant song that’s by no means an apology. It’s a combative, unglossy track on an album full of them. “Lemonade” is the kind of album that a star like Beyoncé (as well as, lately, Rihanna) can release in the streaming era because she’s already guaranteed attention for her every utterance. The album is not beholden to radio formats or presold by a single fans are likely to explore the whole album, streaming every track and hearing how far afield  —   a brass band, stomping   ultraslow    —   Beyoncé is willing to go. As she did with her 2013 album, “Beyoncé,” she has also paired the music with   video that expands and deepens its impact. On their own, the songs can be taken as one star’s personal, domestic dramas, waiting to be mined by the tabloids. But with the video, they testify to situations and emotions countless women endure. It’s not a divorce announcement the singer, songwriter and director is credited as Beyoncé Knowles Carter. Beyoncé released “Lemonade” online at 10 p. m. on April 23, immediately after the HBO showing of the hourlong “visual album” version. It’s a   music video that intersperses the songs, and broadens them, with compelling poetry from the   writer Warsan Shire, poems that often extend women’s physicality toward the archetypal. As Beyoncé recites them, Ms. Shire’s words radically reframe the songs, so they are no longer one woman’s struggles but tribulations shared through generations of mothers and daughters. The video is filled with images of female solidarity and of family, Southern and African roots, women of all ages and roles and eras. Often, Beyoncé is joined by   women in white clothes enacting shared work, gatherings of women or eerie communal rituals. Beyoncé, in multiple hairstyles and fashions, is shown both alluring and unglamorous:   unhappy, sweaty, harshly lit. For the last few songs she often appears in a     dress remade with fabric patterns derived from African textiles, a rich twist. The album title comes from a family gathering that’s shown in the video and heard on a track: the 90th birthday of Hattie White, Jay Z’s grandmother, who says, “I was served lemons but I made lemonade. ” “Lemonade” is not necessarily the album listeners might have expected after “Formation,” the song Beyoncé performed at the Super Bowl with dancers in Black   outfits and in a video clip using images of New Orleans, of   in a plantation mansion and of Beyoncé atop a police car, sinking under a flood. It’s the last song on “Lemonade,” almost a postscript it’s not in the extended video. One other song on “Lemonade” mixes preaching and a prison song (both collected by John and Alan Lomax) a Kendrick Lamar rap and 1960s   psychedelia (sampling the collectors’ item Puerto Rican band Kaleidoscope) to call for “Freedom”: “I break chains all by  ’t let my freedom rot in hell,” Beyoncé vows. But most of “Lemonade” arrives like a   to “Jealous” on the 2013 “Beyoncé,” a song that moans, “I hate you for your lies. ” “Jealous” is offset on “Beyoncé” by songs about ecstatic lust, a topic largely absent on “Lemonade. ” In most of the new songs, Beyoncé has been taken for granted or pushed aside. It’s a situation that, she finds, is both “a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you” and also flabbergasting given that she is, after all, Beyoncé. Beyoncé!: “The baddest woman in the game,” as she sings in “Hold Up. ”  : She is. Her reactions swing from sorrow to rage to determined loyalty, and she reaches beyond the   of “Beyoncé” to embrace new influences and collaborators: the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Father John Misty, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig, Animal Collective and Led Zeppelin. “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” a collaboration with Jack White, is a     that has Beyoncé fighting back, declaring, “You ain’t trying hard   ain’t loving hard enough,” working up to a scream. “Pray You Catch Me” is one of two collaborations with the British songwriter James Blake:   ballads of suspicion and longing. During “Forward,” the other Blake collaboration, the video has its most moving sequence: family members stoically holding photographs of men who were killed by police. It’s followed by a scene of a New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian in full feathered and beaded costume, shaking a tambourine in posh dining rooms as if to exorcise them. Yet eventually, she makes peace with trying to hold on. “Love Drought,” with whispery vocals amid pillowy synthesizers, points out that “10 times out of nine I know you’re lying,” but strives to reconnect. “Sandcastles,” a slow piano hymn that eventually gathers a choir, recalls a   fight but turns a double negative into a positive: “I know I promised that I couldn’t stay,   promise don’t work out that way. ” By the time Beyoncé reaches “All Night,” a gospelly ballad roughened with electric guitar, she resolves to “Give you some time to prove I can trust you again. ” Will it work out? No one knows. But in the meantime she sings wholeheartedly, encapsulates deep dilemmas in terse singalong lines and touches on ideas and emotions that so many people feel. She is a star whose world is vastly different from that of her listeners. But in matters of the heart, with their complications and paradoxes, Beyoncé joins all of us.",0
88,"Trump to Ask for Sharp Increases in Military Spending, Officials Say - The New York Times","Glenn Thrush, Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump will instruct federal agencies on Monday to assemble a budget for the coming fiscal year that includes sharp increases in Defense Department spending and drastic enough cuts to domestic agencies that he can keep his promise to leave Social Security and Medicare alone, according to four senior administration officials. The budget outline will be the first move in a campaign this week to reset the narrative of Mr. Trump’s   White House. A day before delivering a   address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump will demand a budget with tens of billions of dollars in reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department, according to four senior administration officials with direct knowledge of the plan. Social safety net programs, aside from the big entitlement programs for retirees, would also be hit hard. Preliminary budget outlines are usually   administrative exercises, the first step in negotiations between the White House and federal agencies that usually shave the sharpest edges off the initial request. But this plan  —   a product of a collaboration between the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney the National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn and the White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  —   is intended to make a big splash for a president eager to show that he is a man of action. Mr. Trump’s top advisers huddled in the White House this weekend to work on his Tuesday night   address. They focused on a single, often overlooked message amid the chaos of his first weeks in the White House: the assertion that the   candidate is now a president determined to keep audacious campaign promises on immigration, the economy and the budget, no matter how sloppy or disruptive it looks from the outside. “They might not agree with everything you do, but people will respect you for doing what you said you were going to do,” said Jason Miller, a top communications strategist on the Trump campaign who remains close to the White House. “He’s doing something first, and there’s time for talk later,” Mr. Miller added. “This is ultimately how he’s going to get people who didn’t vote, or people who didn’t vote for him, into the fold. Inside the Beltway and with the media, there’s this focus on the palace intrigue. Out in the rest of the country, they are seeing a guy who is focused on jobs and the economy. ” The budget plan, a numerical sketch that will probably be substantially altered by House and Senate Republicans  —   and vociferously opposed by congressional Democrats  —   will be Mr. Trump’s first big step into a legislative fray he has largely avoided during the first 40 days of his administration. Thus far, instead of legislating, he has focused on a succession of executive orders on immigration and deregulation written by Mr. Bannon’s small West Wing team. Resistance from federal agencies could ease some of the deepest cuts in the initial plan before a final budget request is even sent to Congress. And Capitol Hill will have the last word. To meet Mr. Trump’s defense request, lawmakers in both parties would have to agree to raise or end statutory spending caps on defense and domestic programs that were imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Mr. Trump is in a highly unusual position at a time when most presidents are finding their footing or confronting crisis. Despite his lament that he was handed “a mess” by President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump inherited a low unemployment rate, a lack of international crises requiring immediate attention and majorities in both houses of Congress. By contrast, when Mr. Obama took office, the country was losing 700, 000 jobs a month, and the global financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse. By the time he stepped up to the rostrum for his first joint congressional address on Feb. 24, 2009, he had already accrued an impressive string of accomplishments, including the passage of a massive stimulus bill through the   Congress, a gender   act, a children’s health insurance law and executive actions that would ultimately help stabilize the financial and automotive sectors. With the prospect of a second Great Depression still high, Mr. Obama sought to rally the country, vowing, “We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before. ” Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who was Mr. Obama’s first chief of staff, said in an interview Sunday night that Mr. Trump was trying to create a “sense of urgency, which most people aren’t feeling right now, which was a reality to us” in order to generate support for his unspecified economic agenda, including an infrastructure bill and a tax overhaul. “When it comes to all of these executive orders, the question is, does the public view what he’s doing as action or motion?” Mr. Emanuel added. “If you don’t have real action, you create a sense of motion, so the public views it as progress. ” In putting together their budget plans, White House officials are operating under the assumption that the rate of the United States’ economic growth this year will be 2. 4 percent, according to one person who has been briefed on the matter. That is slightly ahead of current projections, but it is well below the 3 percent to 4 percent growth that Mr. Trump promised during the campaign. For next year, the operating assumption is only slightly higher, that person added, a sign that the budget process will not be too out of step with economic reality. The turmoil that has engulfed Mr. Trump’s West Wing is largely of his own devising  —   part of a calculated effort by Mr. Bannon to move boldly despite his team’s lack of experience, and despite the reluctance of many mainstream Republicans to work for a president whom many of them opposed in the party’s brutal primaries. “During his first month in office, President Trump has done exactly what he said he was going to do,” said Thomas Barrack Jr. a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s who ran his inaugural committee. “No president has worked harder or accomplished as much, even with tremendous political resistance forcing him to operate with a small team of outsiders possessing little government experience. ” Lawmakers in both parties have complained that the president’s big words are not yet matched by detailed policy prescriptions or a legislative affairs team capable of executing such undefined promises as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or rewriting the tax code. The budget outline will give Mr. Trump an opportunity to add some specifics to an agenda that has been defined by bellicose speech and the broadest possible policy strokes. Still, aides said Mr. Trump did not plan to change his style for Tuesday’s address. The speech, they said, is likely to have more in common with his clipped inaugural address  —   in which he declared, “The time for empty talk is over”  —   than the   litanies of policy proposals favored by President Bill Clinton or the   invocations of national purpose preferred by President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump’s team, conscious of his recent reversals and a   approval rating that is among the lowest ever recorded, has emphasized his determination to break the partisan gridlock and inaction that has kept congressional approval ratings in the 15 to 30 percent range for years. At the start of an interview last week with Sean Hannity of Fox News at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, called him “President Action, President Impact, Donald J. Trump. ” In a   of Sunday show interviews, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s policy adviser, maintained that the president had accomplished more in his first month than most of his predecessors had in their entire administrations. In reality, most of Mr. Trump’s executive actions have had no more effect on actual policy than news releases. And his     order on the   Partnership trade deal came well after the agreement had been put on life support by labor protests and liberal opposition. One West Wing official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about strategy, said the administration craved the   television images of Mr. Trump at   discussions with business executives every few days on one side, and the vehement protesters of his administration on the other. But his critics say such photo opportunities are all an act, a      rendition of “The Apprentice” by an ineffective rookie president. “This man is not a doer,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, who will host a Monday “ ” of Mr. Trump’s Tuesday speech. “Oh, please. He has nothing to show for what he’s been doing in office for 40 days. It’s all been squandered. ”",0

90,Why Is This Not Watergate? Smoking Gun Emails Discuss “Cleaning Up” Obama/Hillary Emails,Contributing Author,"
This article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge . 
Editor’s Comment: Of course everyone knew, deep down, that Obama was fully aware of Hillary’s private emails, but now there is proof that the campaigns sought to cover up and clean up the evidence to it. Team Hillary went so far as to use bleach bit, a ridiculously thorough way of erasing one’s digital footprint. Before she even takes office, she is embroiled in a scandal many magnitudes bigger than Watergate… and yet… nothing. 
No one falls on their sword; no one drops out; no one is held accountable. It seems that “Teflon” will out-survive even the cockroaches and nuclear wars… 
Can all the media spin and vote rigging really hold all this together? Can the FBI get away with looking the other way, and still pretend to uphold a nation of laws? Will the American people accept her “victory” and go on about their daily lives? 
The Smoking Gun: Cheryl Mills Tells Podesta “We Need To Clean This Up – Obama Has Emails From Her” 
by Tyler Durden
Recall that in a March 2015 interview with CBS, just after the NYT reported of Hillary’s use of a private email server, president Obama told the American public he had only learned about Hillary’s “unusual” arrangement from the press.
As we further reminded readers one month ago, CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante asked Mr. Obama when he learned about her private email system after his Saturday appearance in Selma, Alabama. “ The same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,” the president told Plante. “ The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived ,” Mr. Obama said. “I’m glad that Hillary’s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.”

Unfortunately, the “transparency” of the Obama administration was severely tarnished in late September , when in the FBI’s interview notes with Huma Abedin released by the FBI it was first revealed that Obama had used a pseudonymous email account: “Once informed that the sender’s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: ‘How is this not classified?'” the report says. “Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.”
To be sure, this was not definitive evidence that Obama was aware of Hillary’s email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the Clinton campaign.
That changed today, however, when in the latest Podesta dump we learn that in an email from Cheryl Mills to John Podesta, the Clinton aide upon learning what Obama had just said…

… countered with something quite stunning:
we need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov That, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the Clinton campaign.

As a further reminder, Politico previously reported that the State Department had refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers cited the “presidential communications privilege,” a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. It is therefore unknown what the president’s “alternative” email account was, or who hosted it.
This also explains why in a prior Wikileak, Podesta told Mills in an email titled “Special Category” that she thinks “ we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will. ” Mills did not respond by email.
The Clinton-Obama emails were turned over to the State Department, which later announced it would not release them.
* * *
So just how did Mills and Podesta “clean up” the fact that Obama lied to the American people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect Hillary Clinton.
What we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between March 25-31, just a couple of weeks after Mills said “we need to clean this up,” Bleachbit was used to wipe Hillary’s private server clean. But of course, that is purely a coincidence.
Since we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of US government, or as Cheryl Mills dubbed it a “clean up”, perhaps it is time for the State Department to unveil just what was said between the president and the Clinton campaign?

91,“Chapo Trap House”: New Left-Wing Podcast is a Flagrant Rip-Off of The Right Stuff,Eric Striker,"“Chapo Trap House”: New Left-Wing Podcast is a Flagrant Rip-Off of The Right Stuff 
Eric Striker October 27, 2016 These fags here. 
Last March, a group of Williamsburg trust fund Bernie bros started a podcast called “ Chapo Trap House .”Â The humor style and format of Chapo Trap House content is a left-wing carbon copy of the types of radio shows produced by Alt-Right sensation The Right Stuff , particularly the Daily Shoah, which uses Opie & Anthony style gags and parodies as a vehicle for delivering our counter-cultural and suppressed ideas. 
CTH is trying to invert our ideas, bubble wrap the edges, and use our effective models to try and make Leftism – an ideology that we have exposed and mocked into increasing irrelevance –“cool” by fixing some sunglasses to hide a weak (when put to reason) ideology. 
They have a small troll army on social media, they do (admittedly good) voice impressions, our Counter-Semitic tropes (at least one of the three is Jewish) are replaced by mocking working class White people and Christians, they have memes, albeit even more forced than Dat Boi , they make watered down attempts to pull down some high-profile liberal figures (like we do conservatives). They like to name drop famous comedians like Trevor Moore (of “ Whitest Kids U Know ” fame) as personal friends and have fairly high profile Leftist guests, which makes me think they have professional training or friends in high places. 
Oh, and they spend most of their time attacking the Alt-Right, replacing cuck (our term for them) with “incel,” while demonstratingÂ extensive knowledge of external elements of our counter-culture. They’re obviously very familiar with us, and are trying to create an audience by claiming they’re the real rebels and bomb throwers. Trying to rip-off meme magic 
Yet, their Patreon is flush with cash (way out of proportion to their average plays, i.e. they have big money donors relative to our camp), their Soundcloud and social media pages aren’t muzzled like ours, there’s nobody trying to silence them or shut them down. They can do stuff under their full names, yet mysteriously, their capitalist bosses won’t fire or black list them for calling for the death of capitalists. They get invited to do live performances in some of the Jewiest, most “prestigious,” high rolling and trendy venues in NYC. 
Unlike the Daily Stormer, the Right Stuff or Ricky Vaughn (who they constantly reference with typical Seattle bourgeois shit-lib snark), they can say and do whatever they want because big capital and the American plutocracy is, at the very least, behind the core of their worldview (open borders, amalgamation of cultures and races, feminism). 
Chapo Trap House’s podcast is fairly new, yet already attracting positive attention from our elites. In their defense, they are critical of Hillary Clinton, yet establishment Judeo-Left individuals and institutions, from the Hillary gun-runners at Mediate to Jeet Heer, have commented quite positively on the show. Compared to TRS, they are getting quite a bit of very friendly publicity as a form of reaction to the rise of the Alt-Right. 
But this podcast has no natural audience. So who is it for? 
Most of the blacks and browns who stand on top of the two White male goyim cis male’s in the progressive stack would sucker punch these private school kids who only know what niggers are in theory and steal their iPhones if they had the chance. As for the obese feminists with magenta bowl cuts, they would curl-up into a ball and wail like banshees from all of the micro aggressions these three directly and indirectly engage in. The queers, pedos, trannies, and whatever other group of mentally ill perverts front and center as moral arbitrators of the modern Judeo-Left would distrust them for their pathology of enjoying sexual intercourse with women. Last and not least, most leftists in the West today are humorless, moralistic mental midgets. 
The real purpose of CTH is to staunch the bleeding of young and normal White males coming into our camp in droves right now. By using methods we have proven to resonate with this demographic, they hope to try and sell a state-sanctioned ideology whose only natural endpoint is basically the extermination of us and our families, but with an edgy veneer. This has been done in a different form in the past, it is similar to what the Sony contracted, MTV promoted millionaires in Rage Against the Machine did in the 90’s: plastic revolution in the name of art that isn’t actually revolutionary. 
I , Eric Striker, am calling out Chapo Trap House to have an unedited debate and exchange of ideas with me on their show. Guys on our side are always interviewing and inviting Leftists on our programs and websites, if they have faith in their ideas let’s see them put their parents’ money where their mouth is. 
The Judeo-Left fears free and open discourse due to the inherent weakness of their philosophy. 
Let’s convince them:",1
92,Taiwan Responds After China Sends Carrier to Taiwan Strait - The New York Times,Michael Forsythe and Chris Buckley,"HONG KONG  —   Taiwan scrambled   fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday after China sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported. The transit of the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, came amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China after   Donald J. Trump broke decades of protocol by speaking on the phone with Taiwan’s president, Tsai   after his election victory. Ms. Tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported Taiwan’s formal independence from China. Ms. Tsai, who is visiting Central America this week, made two calls to officials in Taiwan seeking updates on the Liaoning’s transit, the Central News Agency reported, citing Alex Huang, the president’s spokesman. China’s decision to send the carrier through the waterway that separates it from Taiwan reflects an early foreign policy challenge for Mr. Trump. “It’s a show of force, and I think it is intended in part to intimidate, and that’s worrisome from the U. S. and Taiwan’s point of view because we don’t know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “If the Trump administration does see this as a test of U. S. resolve, I suspect they’ll push back pretty forcefully. ” China sent the carrier, which had been conducting exercises in the South China Sea, into the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday morning. Taiwan’s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to Chinese military activity, after Japan and South Korea deployed fighters on Monday. Those actions occurred when a squadron of six Chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate Japan and South Korea and over the Sea of Japan. Taiwan, considered by Beijing to be Chinese territory, has been governed separately since 1949, when the forces of the Nationalist leader Chiang   fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the Communists. China views any assertion of Taiwan’s separateness from the mainland  —   like Ms. Tsai’s call with Mr. Trump  —   as an affront to its claim of sovereignty. Since 1979, the United States has recognized the government in Beijing and broke off formal diplomatic ties to Taiwan as part of the One China policy. In the wake of the   call, China warned the incoming president against making changes to that policy after he takes office on Jan. 20. Liu Zhenmin, a Chinese vice foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the Taiwan Strait was an international waterway and that it was normal for the Liaoning to pass though it. The passage would not have any effect on   relations, he said in remarks carried in the Chinese news media. Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, told reporters in Washington in response to a question about the Liaoning’s passage through the strait that the United States “wouldn’t have a problem” with countries sailing their vessels in international waters as long as it was done in accordance with international law. It also was not the first time the Liaoning had sailed through the strait: It passed through in November 2013 on its way to the South China Sea after having been commissioned only the year before. In that instance, the carrier kept to the western half of the strait, closer to mainland China. In a statement on Wednesday morning, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said that the Liaoning was also staying to the west of the strait’s middle and urged citizens to remain calm. A transit on the eastern side, closer to Taiwan, would be viewed as much more provocative. Euan Graham, the director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said that for the Chinese, traveling through the strait was a logical way to move from one area of fleet operations to another along its long coastline. In order for warships based in northern ports, like the Liaoning, to return home from southern waters, they must either pass close to Japanese islands or transit the Taiwan Strait. “Geography forces a very binary choice,” he said. Mr. Graham said it was important to see how the Liaoning conducted its passage. If it had aircraft on deck and was conducting flight operations, that would be seen as more provocative than if it passed through the strait with the aircraft in its hangar bay, he said. The Liaoning, commissioned in 2012 and built from a Soviet hull, is China’s first aircraft carrier. In past decades, the United States has shown its resolve to defend Taiwan by sailing carriers through the Taiwan Strait. In 1995, the aircraft carrier Nimitz transited the strait amid heightened tensions after Beijing conducted missile exercises in the waters. China’s military   is highly secretive, but it would seem inconceivable for the Liaoning to pass through such contested waters without approval from the president, Xi Jinping, who is also the chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the military. And the Chinese military media has described the aircraft carrier as embodying Mr. Xi’s plans for a stronger navy, capable of projecting force far beyond China’s territorial waters. Last Thursday, the front page of People’s Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, featured a report about the aircraft carrier’s latest journey under the headline, “We’re sailing under the leader’s attentive gaze,” a clear tribute to Mr. Xi. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said in a news conference on Wednesday that the Liaoning’s passage was part of the ship’s scheduled training in the western Pacific, which had begun on Dec. 24. Mr. Ma also said that the   relationship in the coming year would face “increasing uncertainty, looming risks and challenges. ” He added that Taiwan’s government and “independence forces” there had “seriously threatened the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” accusing them of engaging in separatist activities and warning that China would “resolutely safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. ” The aircraft carrier’s passage was part of a cluster of recent acts by the Chinese military that have raised hackles in the region. Last month, a Chinese warship seized an underwater drone belonging to the United States Navy about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. The drone was returned after the Obama administration publicly chided China over the seizure. On Monday, Japan said it had sent fighter jets into the air after Chinese bombers and surveillance planes flew over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan. “When China was militarily weaker, Japan considered that area to be its backyard,” said Ni Lexiong, a naval affairs researcher at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. “This was a way of telling Japan that if there ever is conflict, the location of any future battle space won’t be decided by you and America. We have the initiative. So Japan, don’t think of meddling further afield in Taiwan or the South China Sea. ”",0

95,Explosive Assange/Pilger Interview on US Election: Expect Riots if Hillary Wins,wmw_admin,"By wmw_admin on November 6, 2016 Darkmoon — Nov 6, 2016 RT : “Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special [released late yesterday] courtesy of Dartmouth Films. Here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails leaked by WikiLeaks this year.” LD : Despite the enormous populist support for Trump and the extraordinary loathing in which Hillary Clinton is held by millions of American, Assange says that “Trump cannot be allowed to win.” Trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses, given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches, compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by Hillary Clinton on similar occasions. Recent news reports reveal that “election related violence is increasing and Right-wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if Mrs Clinton ‘steals’ the election, as they fear will happen.” If Hillary Clinton wins this election, as Assange predicts, we can expect riots to erupt all across America. Violent insurrection, in the circumstances of a rigged election, would appear to be more than justified. Hillary Clinton clearly belongs behind bars, not in the White House. [LD] John Pilger (left) conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Here is a transcript of the interview followed by the YouTube interview itself. Click to enlarge THE SECRET WORLD OF THE US ELECTION John Pilger: What’s the significance of the FBI’s intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? Julian Assange: If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively America’s political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI’s investigation, so there’s anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. We’ve published about 33,000 of Clinton’s emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half — 30,000 — to herself, and we’ve published about half. Then there are the Podesta emails we’ve been publishing. John Podesta is Hillary Clinton’s primary campaign manager, so there’s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. ‘Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks’ PILGER : The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. ASSANGE : The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. ‘Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton’ PILGER : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. I’m thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. ASSANGE : And twelve million dollars from Morocco … PILGER : Twelve million from Morocco, yeah. ASSANGE : For Hillary Clinton to attend a party. PILGER : In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, that’s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. ASSANGE : There’s an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well it’s just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. PILGER : The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. ASSANGE : Under Hillary Clinton, the world’s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. PILGER : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : That’s extraordinary. ‘Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition’ ASSANGE : I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? She’s a centralising cog. You’ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. She’s the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. She’s the smooth central representation of all that, and ‘all that’ is more or less what is in power now in the United States. It’s what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. PILGER : Didn’t Citybank supply a list… ? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : Which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? ASSANGE : If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. So I think you can’t properly understand Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. ‘Libya is Hillary Clinton’s war’ PILGER : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us – told you – about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clinton’s invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? ASSANGE : Libya, more than anyone else’s war, was Hillary Clinton’s war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. That’s documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; there’s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that we’ve published, just about Libya. It’s not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state — something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and it’s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa — previously people fleeing those problems didn’t end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: ‘What do these Europeans think they’re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? There’s going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. ‘Trump won’t be permitted to win’ PILGER : You get complaints from people saying, ‘What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House?’ ASSANGE : My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he’s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn’t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies… big foreign money … are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. PILGER : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, ‘Well, why doesn’t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?’ ASSANGE : We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our Russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. PILGER : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? ASSANGE : Let’s talk about Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, which Hillary Clinton called ‘deplorable and irredeemable’. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly — through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies — represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. ‘US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status’ PILGER : I’d like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we’re doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuador’s support for you? ASSANGE : Let’s let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than £12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now there’s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds — so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election campaign, the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. It means that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. PILGER : Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. ASSANGE : I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last fifteen years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won’t happen]. PILGER : People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. ASSANGE : Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that they’re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, I’m a bit institutionalised — this [the embassy] is the world … it’s visually the world for me. PILGER : It’s the world without sunlight, for one thing, isn’t it? ASSANGE : It’s the world without sunlight, but I haven’t seen sunlight in so long, I don’t remember it. PILGER : Yes. ASSANGE : So , yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children — they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. That’s a hard, hard adaption which they didn’t ask for. PILGER : Do you worry about them? ASSANGE : Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. ‘I am innocent and in arbitrary detention’ PILGER : Some people would say, ‘Well, why don’t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden?’ ASSANGE : The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. So it’s me and the U.N. verses Sweden and the U.K. Who’s right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that those countries must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, ‘What’s going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? Assange says that you should recognise his asylum.’ And here is. Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, ‘No, we’re not going to recognise the UN ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesn’t suit the Western establishment narrative — that yes, the West has political prisoners, it’s a reality, it’s not just me, there’s a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They don’t call them political prisoners in China, they don’t call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they don’t call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. ASSANGE : Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared by the Stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? PILGER : Yes, it’s different. ASSANGE : The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. The rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.",1
96,Telescope That ‘Ate Astronomy’ Is on Track to Surpass Hubble - The New York Times,Dennis Overbye,"GREENBELT, Md.  —   The next great space telescope spread its golden wings this month. Like the petals of a   sunflower seeking the light, the 18 hexagonal mirrors that make up the heart of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope were faced toward a   balcony overlooking a cavernous clean room at the Goddard Space Flight Center here. Inside the room, reporters and a gaggle of space agency officials, including the ebullient administrator Charles Bolden, were getting their pictures taken in front of the giant mirror. Now, after 20 years with a budget of $8. 7 billion, the Webb telescope is on track and on budget to be launched in October 2018 and sent a million miles from Earth, NASA says. The telescope, named after NASA Administrator James Webb, who led the space agency in the 1960s, is the   successor of the Hubble Space Telescope. Seven times larger than the Hubble in   ability, the Webb was designed to see farther out in space and deeper into the past of the universe. It may solve mysteries about how and when the first stars and galaxies emerged some 13 billion years ago in the smoky aftermath of the Big Bang. Equipped with the sort of infrared goggles that give troops and police officers night vision, the Webb would peer into the dust clouds and gas storms of the Milky Way in which stars and planets are presently being birthed. It would be able to study planets around other stars. That has been NASA’s dream since 1996 when the idea for the telescope was conceived with a projected price tag then of $500 million But as recently as six years ago, the James Webb Space Telescope was, in the words of Nature magazine, “the telescope that ate astronomy,” mismanaged, over budget and behind schedule so that it had crushed everything else out of NASA’s science budget. A House subcommittee once voted to cancel it. Instead, the program was rebooted with a strict spending cap. The scientific capabilities of the telescope emerged unscathed from that period, astronomers on the project say. The major change, said Jonathan P. Gardner, the deputy senior project scientist, was to simplify the testing of the telescope. Most of the pain was dealt to other NASA projects like a proposed space telescope to study dark energy, which the National Academy of Sciences had hoped to put on a fast track to be launched this decade. It’s now delayed until 2025 or so. Typically for NASA, the Webb telescope was a technologically ambitious project, requiring 10 new technologies to make it work. Bill Ochs, a veteran Goddard engineer who became project manager in 2010 during what he calls the “replan,” said the key to its success so far, was having enough money in the budget to provide a cushion for nasty surprises. The telescope smiling up at us like a giant Tiffany shaving mirror is 6. 5 meters in diameter, or just over 21 feet, compared with 2. 4 meters for the Hubble. The aim is to explore a realm of cosmic history about 150 million to one billion years after time began  —   known as the reionization epoch, when bright and violent new stars and the searing radiation from quasars were burning away a gloomy fog of hydrogen gas that prevailed at the end of the Big Bang. In fact, astronomers don’t know how the spectacle that greets our eyes every night when the sun goes down or the lights go out wrenched itself into luminous existence. They theorize that an initial generation of stars made purely of hydrogen and helium  —   the elements created during the Big Bang  —   burned ferociously and exploded apocalyptically,   the seeding of the cosmos with progressively more diverse materials. But nobody has ever seen any   Population 3 stars, as those first stars are known. They don’t exist in the modern universe. Astronomers have to hunt them in the dim past. That ambition requires the Webb to be tuned to a different kind of light than our eyes or the Hubble can see. Because the expansion of the cosmos is rushing those earliest stars and galaxies away from us so fast, their light is “ ” to longer wavelengths the way the siren from an ambulance shifts to a lower register as it passes by. So blue light from an infant galaxy bursting with bright spanking new stars way back then has been stretched to invisible infrared wavelengths, or heat radiation, by the time it reaches us 13 billion years later. As a result, the Webb telescope will produce cosmic postcards in colors no eye has ever seen. It also turns out that infrared emanations are the best way to study exoplanets, the worlds beyond our own solar system that have been discovered in the thousands since the Webb telescope was first conceived. In order to see those infrared colors, however, the telescope has to be very cold  —   less than 45 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero  —   so that its own heat does not swamp the heat from outer space. Once in space, the telescope will unfold a giant umbrella the size of a tennis court to keep the sun off it. The telescope, marooned in permanent shade a million miles beyond the moon, will experience an infinite cold soak. The sunshield consists of five thin,   layers of a material called Kapton. Way too big to fit into a rocket, the shield, as well as the telescope mirror, will have be launched folded up. It will then be unfolded in space in a series of some 180 maneuvers that look in computer animations like a cross between a parachute opening and a swimming pool cover going into place. Or at least that is the $8 billion plan. Engineers have done it on the ground, and it worked. The same people who refolded the shield after each test will fold it again, in a process Mr. Ochs compares to packing up your parachute before a jump. The test will come in space, where no one will be able to help if things go wrong. That whole process will amount to what Mr. Ochs called “six months of high anxiety. ” “For the most part, it all has to work,” Mr. Ochs said. The last time NASA did something this big astronomically, in 1990, things didn’t quite work. Once in orbit, the Hubble couldn’t be focused it had a misshapen mirror that had never been properly tested. Astronauts eventually fitted it with corrective lenses, and it went on to become the crown jewel of astronomy. Making sure that doesn’t happen this time is the agenda for the next two years. “Our telescope is finished,” John C. Mather, the senior project scientist, said. “Now we are about to prove it works. ” In the coming weeks, the mirror and the box of scientific instruments on its back will be put on a rig and shaken to simulate the vibrations of a launch, and then sealed in an acoustic chamber and bombarded with the noise of a launch. If the parts survive unscathed, the telescope assembly will be shipped to a giant vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. There it will be chilled to the   temperatures at which it will have to work, and engineers will actually focus the telescope, twiddling the controls for seven actuators on each of the 18 mirror segments. No Hubble surprises here. Then the telescope will go to Los Angeles to be mounted on its gigantic sunshield. That whole contraption, now too big for even the giant   military transport plane, will travel by ship through the Panama Canal to French Guiana. It will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket supplied by the European Space Agency as part of Europe’s contribution to the observatory, and go into orbit around the sun at a point called L2 about a million miles from Earth. Canada, NASA’s other partner, supplied some of the instruments. Then come the six months of anxiety. Sometime in the spring of 2019, if all goes well, the telescope will record its first real image  —   of what, the assembled astronomers were not ready to guess. In a bonus undreamed of when the Webb telescope was first conceived, it looks as if the Hubble will still be going strong when the Webb is launched. They will share the sky and the potential for joint observing projects. A million miles apart, they can view objects in the solar system from different angles, providing a kind of stereoscopic perspective. Besides the expected baby galaxies and the exoplanets, there are, as astronomers like to remind us, always new surprises (like colliding black holes when the LIGO observatory was turned on last year) when humanity devises a new way to look at the sky. Asked what the telescope’s greatest discovery would be, Dr. Mather said, “If I knew, I would tell you. ” Nor would the project members talk about contingency plans to rescue the telescope if anything goes wrong a million miles from Earth. There are no plans to fix it or bring it back. They know how to attach a probe or robot to the telescope, Dr. Mather said, but “we are planning to not need it, thank you. ”",0
97,Closed Afghan-Pakistani Border Is Becoming ‘Humanitarian Crisis’ - The New York Times,Mujib Mashal,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Pakistan has kept its border crossings with Afghanistan sealed for more than two weeks, with thousands of Afghan visitors stranded in Pakistan and traders unable to move their vegetables and fruit across. After a suicide bombing at a shrine in Pakistan’s Sindh Province on Feb. 16, which killed more than 80 people, the Pakistani military shut its borders with Afghanistan, saying the terrorists behind the attack had sanctuaries in the country. It also carried out shelling into Afghanistan. Omar Zakhilwal, Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan, said Sunday that if the border did not open soon, his government would be forced to airlift its stranded citizens, which could be a new low in the relationship between the neighboring countries. Their   border has long been a contentious issue. Ever since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, Afghan and Western officials have said that the Afghan insurgency’s leadership maintains havens in Pakistan, particularly in the city of Quetta. The free movement across the border has helped the militants avoid defeat in a   war led by the United States. In recent years, the Pakistani authorities have said the leaders of the militant groups waging deadly attacks inside their territory are based across the border in Afghanistan. Mr. Zakhilwal, the Afghan ambassador, said some leaders of these attacks on Pakistan might be in Afghanistan, but they mostly operate in areas controlled by the Afghan Taliban. He said his government, along with the United   coalition, had targeted Pakistani militants in Afghanistan, including the mastermind of a massacre of children in a Pakistani school in 2014. Imran Khan, an opposition leader in Pakistan, said on Saturday that the border closing was “building into a humanitarian crisis. ” He called on both governments to resolve the crisis so “those with valid travel documents and perishable goods” could cross. Afghan officials have protested the closing, saying that Pakistan has used the shrine attack as a pretext to pressure Afghanistan economically. Mr. Zakhilwal said Pakistan was making a “flawed connection” between the shrine attack and the border. The assault on the shrine was claimed by the Islamic State, whose regional chapter is largely made up of fighters from the Pakistani tribal areas. Afghan forces in the east have been fighting the group, which has also carried out deadly attacks inside Afghanistan, for nearly two years. If the reason for blocking the border is to stop the flow of terrorists into Pakistan, Mr. Zakhilwal said it made no sense to prevent the return of the thousands of Afghans stranded in Pakistan, many of whom had traveled there for medical reasons. The long border is porous, and Pakistan is focusing only on the formal crossing points. In Kabul, the toll of the border closing is evident in the markets, with the price of fruit and vegetables imported from Pakistan more than doubling. But the price for many other goods has been unaffected, because Afghanistan also imports from Iran and some Central Asian nations. Nasir Ahmad, a shopkeeper at Kabul’s vegetable market, said a crate of oranges that used to be $4 had increased to $12. A box of bananas, which used to be about $12, is now about $25. Khanjan Alokozay, the deputy chairman of the Afghan chamber of commerce, estimated that traders from both countries were losing about $4 million a day because of the border closing. Pakistani traders are bearing about 80 percent of those losses, because during the winter Pakistani exports of fruit and vegetables to Afghanistan increase. Mr. Alokozay said thousands of trucks on both sides of the border had remained stranded, and Afghan businessmen have been urged to find other routes to transport their goods. Since the closing, Afghan border officials said that Pakistan was allowing only funeral processions to cross over. Some of those stranded have resorted to paying smugglers and taking dangerous mountain passes to return home. “Pakistanis are not allowing anyone to cross the border, and they order their forces to shoot anyone who is trying to cross the border,” said Haji Iqbal, an Afghan who recently returned from Pakistan with the help of friends who asked Pakistani forces to let him cross through a mountain pass. “I walked for two hours. ”",0
98,TV Anchors Arrive at the White House for Lunch with Donald Trump - Breitbart,Kristina Wong,"News anchors arrived at the White House Thursday afternoon for a private lunch with President Trump after a week of negative news reports and before he heads on his first overseas trip, a   visit to the Middle East and Europe.

S. elections and any collusion with the Trump campaign. According to the Independent Journal Review: “I believe it hurts the country terribly because it shows we’re a divided,     country,” he said, according to CNN. “And we have very important things to do right now,” he added, citing trade deals, military issues, and the spread of nuclear weapons. “It also happens to be a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election that they should have easily won because of the Electoral College being slated so much in their way,” he said. “That’s all this is. I think it shows division, and it shows that we’re not together as a country. And I think it’s a very, very negative thing. ” Trump closed his comments by stating that “hopefully, this can go quickly, because we have to show unity if we’re going to do great things with respect to the rest of the world. ” This is the second time Trump has met with TV news anchors privately. The first time was before his address to a joint session of Congress. Pelley reportedly moved the CBS evening news show from New York to Washington partly as a result of the lunch. Trump, who has blasted CNN as “fake news,” is an avid consumer of cable news and reportedly recently installed a new large screen TV in the White House.",0

100,The Beautiful Prehistoric World: Is Earth Now a Wasteland?,Editor,"By Pao Chang
Earth is a beautiful blue planet that has gone through many changes. Some people believed that Earth used to be a world filled with mythical creatures and magic. Others believed it used to have a landscape that is more beautiful than the picture below.
The following two videos reveal some very interesting information about what Earth may look like tens of thousands of years ago or possibly hundreds of thousands of years ago. Did Earth use to have trees as large as small mountains? Are there actually no forests on Earth? Is Earth now a wasteland? The videos below might have clues to help answer these questions. Watch the videos and come up with your own conclusions.

101,I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Here’s What I Learned. - The New York Times,Farhad Manjoo,"I spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didn’t read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president. What I missed, by many accounts, was one of the strangest and most unpredictable weeks of news in modern political history. Among other things, there was the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and an “Oprah Winfrey Show” tape that led to the downfall of the nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew F. Puzder. It wasn’t my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours) but shifted most of my energy to looking for   zones. My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no   part of the press. But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else. The new president doesn’t simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow. Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be   and averted my eyes as I scrolled for   news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for   sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.) Even when I found   news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a    cake without getting any fruit or nuts. It wasn’t just news. Mr. Trump’s presence looms over much more. There he is off in the wings of “The Bachelor” and even “The Big Bang Theory,” whose creator, Chuck Lorre, has taken to inserting   messages in the closing credits. Want to watch an awards show? Say the Grammys or the Golden Globes? Trump Trump Trump. How about sports? Yeah, no. The president’s policies are an animating force in the N. B. A. He was the subtext of the Super Bowl: both the game and the commercials, and maybe even the halftime show. Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon. com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wife’s Valentine’s Day present. (I bought her jewelry.) All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. It’s possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past  —   say, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler  —   dominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now. I’m hedging because there isn’t data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence. Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures “earned media,” which is all coverage that isn’t paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising. In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuant’s records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the company’s chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obama’s monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July. It’s not just that Mr. Trump’s coverage beats anyone else’s. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1, 000 of the world’s best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million) Kim Kardashian ($36 million) and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million) all the way down to the 1, 000th   celebrity in mediaQuant’s database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1, 001). The coverage those 1, 000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1, 000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatori’s preliminary figures. How do we know Mr. Trump is more talked about than anyone else in the past? There are now more people on the planet who are more connected than ever before. Facebook estimates that about 3. 2 billion people have internet connections. On average, the people of Earth spend about eight hours a day consuming media, according to the marketing research firm Zenith. So almost by definition, anyone who dominates today’s media is going to be read about, talked about and watched by more people than ever before. “From a media perspective, it’s pretty clear,” Mr. Senatori said. “The sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, he’s off the charts. ” Mr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet there’s an argument that our   modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond what’s called for. On most days, Mr. Trump is 90 percent of the news on my Twitter and Facebook feeds, and probably yours, too. But he’s not 90 percent of what’s important in the world. During my break from Trump news, I found rich coverage veins that aren’t getting social play. ISIS is retreating across Iraq and Syria. Brazil seems on the verge of chaos. A large ice shelf in Antarctica is close to full break. Scientists may have discovered a new continent submerged under the ocean near Australia. There’s a reason you aren’t seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike   media, today’s media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable. Scholars have long predicted that social media might alter how we choose cultural products. In 2006, Duncan Watts, a researcher at Microsoft who studies social networks, and two colleagues published a study arguing that social signals create a kind of “inequality” in how we choose media. The researchers demonstrated this with an online market for music downloads. Half of the people who arrived at Mr. Watts’s   site were shown just the titles and band name of each song. The other half were also shown a social signal  —   how many times each song had been downloaded by other users. Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular. I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. It’s not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals  —   likes, retweets and more  —   are amplifying it. Every new story prompts outrage, which puts the stories higher in your feed, which prompts more coverage, which encourages more talk, and on and on. We saw this effect before Mr. Trump came on the scene  —   it’s why you know about Cecil the lion and Harambe the gorilla  —   but he has accelerated the trend. He is the Harambe of politics, the undisputed king of all media. It’s only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone  —   reporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news  —   has been amped up to 11. For now, this might be all right. It’s important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening. But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And it’s probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long. In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Today’s newspapers are also full of   articles, but many of us aren’t reading newspapers anymore. We’re reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else. There’s no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, he’s not everything  —   and it’d be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.",0
