The jupyter notebook predicts the reliability of newsfeed

Developed a machine learning model to classify the authenticity of articles by training it on a dataset that contains labeled articles as "fake" or "real". The dataset was preprocessed to remove unwanted information and transformed into a suitable format to be fed to the machine learning algorithm. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets. The machine learning model was trained on the training set using algorithms like decision trees or random forests, with text conversion techniques such as TF-IDF to transform the text into numerical vectors. The model's performance was evaluated on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, the trained model was used to predict whether new articles are fake or real by converting their text into numerical vectors using the same preprocessing techniques and passing them through the trained model.
